When an emergency call, a professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During the calls to the hotline's voice professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend, and it is necessary to come to their house.
Lamb had maintained that his "sweet dog" was the house alive and probably upset, and that the contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on a white office paper: "I'm so sorry, and I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy and she is the only one that ever loved me," said the letter, which was signed by Lamb, according to the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would he go 300 miles on the school's campus, where police believe the favorite professor Ethan Schmidt's shot at the door of his office.
The chief of police in Delta State University Lynn Buford said that the university staff heard shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
Lamb said he made the fateful phone call to the emergency line shortly thereafter.
Then came another death; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting has forced students and faculty to hide behind a locked door, he delegated authority is still trying to figure out what was the Lamb's motivation.
The details, which published the investigators on the side of the state, and students and staff who knew him, jointly created the image of a talented, but is likely to be a teacher.
Students have confirmed that his lessons enjoyed.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt, myself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in a thank-you "wonderful people" with whom he shared academic life.
They both taught at the school of social sciences and history, along with the other 17 members of the faculty, and many students took classes at both at the same time.
At the same time, the inclination when it comes to the problems.
The student, who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also appeared agitated and shaken, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, argued that Lamb told him that he has to deal with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb has previously called for Delta State University on a leave of absence for health reasons, when he said that he has a problem.
And this year, only two online courses taught.
Recent changes to the university's recruitment meant that a PhD on which Lamb worked hard, he had not guaranteed automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.
University President William La Forge said that he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr Lamb obviously worried about something."
On these questions for us Lamb doesn't answer.
After he left the campus, police caught his foot when he crossed the border state of Arkansas back into Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb jedinýmvýstřelem killed himself from a gun in the courtyard of a house about a mile from their parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, coroner confirmed Washington State, Methel Johnson.
The car left running on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went into this house, although Johnson said that he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb started work at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which represents about 12,000 people, in 2009, and taught geography and hours of training.
In the spring gained a doctorate in education.
One of the long-time friends Lamb described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carl Hairston said that she was 15 and Lamb 20, when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older boy who her guitar tutor for several years.
It was then quite a heartbreaker.
The heart of all girls softened as soon as he appeared, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss together allegedly for some time to come.
During the emergency call, Lamb said: "I've killed my wife," but the record of marriage never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which is adjacent to the cutoff Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O Steen, said that broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years.
"It was completely collapsed," said O Steen about her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O Steen said he met with Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, when combined with Abigail vystuopovali at a summer festival three years ago.
Later, played together random gigy.
O Steen said that his daughter writes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep, Room, a dimly lighted bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, sweat, Lamb played guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We fooled around each other and recording a joke.
I mean, that both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, killed by a professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the student council and the government's boyish students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, staff, students and members of the community, attended commemorations of candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff vigílie Schnidt also attended, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," says La Forge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Pisatelky for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story has been amended to reflect the fact that the police now say that Lamb made a call to the hotline after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb Prentiss, he called his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.

8 polling numbers, which show that Donald Trump in real light
Some are trying to identify him as the man who often change their minds.
Other above shrugged off as over a half-wit.
And some are preparing for an implosion.
But some Republicans trying to download Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, they do it (so far).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of two-digit number, and some people are beginning to really question what it means for nominating the chances of this with real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that in this time of the year 2011 Rick Perry's leadership has made its way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, neither of them didn't win a single status in the nominating process.
There are many reasons why he could face in the general election.
But the outside groups such as the Super PAC Jeb Bush and economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's willingness to endure and are starting to interpret their dollars to stop to overthrow him.
Here are some recent polling numbers, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's assessment of the has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of the real estate magnate.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
He now has six in 10 Republicans favourable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are in the early stages of holds.
A Quinnipiac University poll, which was conducted last week, found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Donald Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN /, which took place last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiasm" or "happy" with Donald Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said that they were "outraged" of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they were "thrilled" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the undertaking Jeb Bush became a favorite candidate.
Most Republicans see Mr. Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide is friendly to the idea that the real-estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to the ABC News / Washington Post poll.
The same number is holding a club in the state of Iowa, who is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of the leader, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think he has the personality to serve effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents, says that his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When he puts on his učenecké hats, Republican voters think that Trump is a viable candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said that Trump was the best option, according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 have bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn't have in the past, the clearest crystal ball.
By this time in the last cycle, 4 in 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of a candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Yet, it appears that a certain number of voters see the GOP campaign Trump as credible.
Even if Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump as well as almost everyone.
Some scholars argue that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-diffusely Trumpovská aid is distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But from the beginning of September, Monmouth University poll shows that in a hypothetical direct rivalry between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates will gain Trump almost always majority support.
He runs over Carly Fiorinou by 13 points, Marco Rubio of 14 points, Walker about 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasichem, Chris Christie by 33 points for each.
It is in a race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beat him?
Ben Carson would lead over a trader on the broad 19 points in a hypothetical match one-on-one.
The bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters argue that he has already made up its mind.
A new CBS / NYT poll Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters supporting Trump says he won't change his mind.
It is clear that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that would never changed his mind.
46 percent of the states that keeping options open for change among the candidates.
Still, Mr. Trump is the strongest opponent of his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their minds in the final, they were twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 in 10 Republicans reportedly agrees with Donald Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "thugs" in the notification of his campaign's immigration speech still holds as the principal and the central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump's bombast key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and the damage to a re-branding effort.
But according to a new Monday ABC / Post poll, six in 10 Republicans argue that agrees with Donald Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration will remain in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain too.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today are roughly half the support from Republican voters, mainly due to their status as outsiders.
Six in 10 Republicans vote on Monday night in a new ABC / Post claims that they want a political outsider, rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "very angry."
House of supported a greater share of the state charges for coal.
Czech Republic will gain more than $400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies in the first reading supported the government's amendments to the Mining Act, which governs the amount of revenue from lignite opencast mining fees from mining companies.
The Secretary of State John () promised MPs that it will receive extra money to the Treasury and municipal budgets.
The draft criticized members of the opposition, who fear that the mining company will no longer want to sponsor community as before, because they pay higher fees directly to the state government rozpočtu.Sněmovna at first reading supported an amendment to the Mining Act, which among other things means that the state should receive a greater share of revenue from fees from surface mining of coal from the mining company.
The state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
also changing the method of calculating remuneration for minerals, which the company will benefit.
The change in charges for the extraction of minerals has to bring into state coffers of 427 million more than in 2013.
On municipal revenue has to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee has to be higher.
In the year gained community of fees of roughly $450 million and the state budget of $150 million.
It was brown coal mining communities about $200 million and State 66 million.
counts even with the increase in the remuneration of difference space with a mining at 1,000 pennies per hectare per year.
Revenue from these payments has continued to fully belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister John () Members, said that the community because it will gain a year instead of $14 million to 100 million.
The level of mining fees will determine the law, but it sets by government decree.
The payment shall be calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for different kinds of minerals.
According to the government is the reason for the change, among others, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
Thu but warned that setting the fee by Government regulation may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to the minister, in this case, however, it is not a tax because the state it is levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees are only community, whose territory are affected by mining.
In the case of coal will get three-quarters of the money the community and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be even in the case of mining radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the state on charges of mining picks will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the mining or to ensure the safety of the service.
The draft criticized the opposition MPs, who argued in particular that damaged communities affected by mining and districts.
For example, Michal Kučera (the top 09 and) warned that mining companies are no longer want to sponsor community as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible for one of the world's poorest regions, only to have Mr. Finance Minister budget," said David (Dawn) elected in the county.
A rise in unemployment on the Hana Aulická MP has warned.
Aulická and unsuccessfully proposed an amendment rejected, he wanted to return the government to.
The statement says that according to the mining companies to increase fees into the price of coal, because prices are more than 90 percent of long-term contracted.
The main consumers like power plants or CHP would therefore shouldn't feel the price growth.
"On the other hand, this really increases the risk that the mining organisations will increase in payments to compensate for efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which would essentially mean a reduction in the number of employees," admits the government.
According to her, however, is an increase in fees in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur to's of Urbana () is key to MPs, before the law knew the conclusions on the updated energy concept, and most importantly, the government's decision to cap coal mining.
If coal will also benefit for the limits, then it will have an impact on revenue for the state and municipalities, pointed out.
Urban Mládkem disagrees with that decision on breaking the limit on the bottom of the army should fall until after 2020.
Limits on the bottom, he says, should break for social reasons, and because of the long-term stability of the economy at large domestic energy.

Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyna debut at PMQ's very enthusiastically awaited
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will have its debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will lay the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be closely studied the media and MPs.

Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the center of attention a few stories on the front pages of newspapers.
The decision by Mr Corbyna no singing the national anthem at each attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyna said he would be "stood in respectful silence" and that he sees "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of the shadow cabinet, Mr Corbyna, Owen Smith, told the programme the BBC Two's Newsnight afterwards that he would recommend labouristickému leaders to sing the national anthem "without prejudice" on his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen ministers refused to serve in a top team of Mr Corbyna, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the political differences in work also "add up" after the appointment of Mr Corbyna over his position in the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.
Mr. "TUC Corbyl said at a conference that the Workers' Party to submit an amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a cap on benefits.

Mr Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which has faced David Cameron over the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Labour Party, which promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from the crowd" to questions for Mr Cameron and got more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that are PMQ too confrontational and to refrain from like-minded "replies," so the sprocket trade, and instead promises that will focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, to represent him at PMQ, if you will - as, for example, when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped from ideas that would let other colleagues to speak out from time to time for him, because he said that they had discussed the matter with the Speaker of the House John.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, said he wanted to depart from the style of politics "Punch and Judy," which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, were seen as a key barometer of judgement PMQ leaders, their leadership of the House and their attitude among other MPs, although critics have argued that have become a caricature of itself and far-reaching reforms are needed.

Metcash is launching a campaign in the country to fight with the invasion, Aldi
Metcash's IGA seeks to protect its business from the onslaught of Aldi in Southern and Western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the country to fight with the invasion, Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers, and the first of more than 120 stores in Southern and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and build brand by IGA marketing in the mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added to brands such as an ice cream maker based in Dunsborough Simmo 'with tastings in shops and IGA store owners sell discounted tickets for Australian soccer league to local customers.
It is expected that the Metcash will publish further details of their defense strategy on 29 September, when sales of food, alcohol and hardware will celebrate its annual strategic investor day.
The stakes are high, because the southern and western Australia represent nearly 30 percent of the IGA Metcash business steps and generate a higher turnover than Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in the South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores are enjoying a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts such as Morgan Stanley, believes that Aldi losing up to 5 percent of the food market in these two states during the 12 months since the opening of the first stores, which took sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, in its report, Morgan Stanley analyst, Tom Kierath, estimated that retail IGA could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi to open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes at a fixed price basis Metcash could cost him about $13 million in income before tax, confirmed Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly against Coles and Aldi, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks Metcash food sales fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will be reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne could be "highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it is known that a member of the board of Metcash contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent from 2010 and earnings of Metcash's food business, which provides about 1,200 retailers IGA, fell by 43 percent from 2012, which reflects the operational development of speculation, as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale counterattacked and invest more than $150 million a year to supplement the pultové prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and so helps retailers to re-equip IGA stores by the addition of the fast-growing food and news from individuals.
The managing director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that the price margins to be paid and retrofitting programmes shops caught momentum and hopes to return to the basic velkoprodej profitable growth in profit in the year 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis Tennis Australia president Steve Healy by
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise for their behavior, rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became collateral damage in the recent fuss around her boyfriend Nick Kyrgiose and deserve praise for their behavior rather than criticism, cites Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called the "Special Ks," drew unwanted attention to yourself, thanks to the affair with the infamous Kyrgiosem and Stan, at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in the heat of a qualification game in Cincinnati, had to be Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison twice separated the referee, Harrison said afterwards: "Kyrgiosovi Wawrinka had one stretch, and I had to pull him too."
While he was last seen as smashes racket after he had been thwarted by possible overcoming cramp Richard at the US Open, staunchly defended Kokkinakise Healy.
The youngster is currently located in Glasgow, where they compete with Sam Groth on location in the second singles spot for Bernard Romicem in Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"Pretty much, I thought about that, in my opinion, was dragged into the dispute Thanasi a little bit," says Healy.
He destroyed a rocket when they lost because of a cramp in the US, but it's not the first player who would take over the frustration of itself took his anger out on his racquet. I know Thanasiho well enough, and I can tell you at this event will be proud of.
But seriously, handled very well, because he was in the U.S. exposed to very provocative circumstances because of Harrison and so forth, so in my opinion, deserves great credit.
He's got a fantastic team, also has a great family around him, and I think he was being a bit hard.
It's a very grown-up 19-year-old man has been working very hard and it fits perfectly into the team and so on, never had a problem with the other players in the dressing room is a very respected, he trains hard, he's in great shape, it's a very stable and mature young man and I just think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgiose because of an important match, which starts on Friday, and states that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports compatriot from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term.
"First of all, we want to make our team was very focused on the game and not at all the controversy that [he] was created around him," says Healy.
And I think that Nick was rising very quickly, as Federer, Murray and others point out, in the eyes of the public is growing fast, also made some terrible mistakes and they deserve all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to support him, we're trying to help him to understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight, where he will be able to think about it is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for himself.
Europe's migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closing the border and detaining migrants
After the announcement of the state of emergency Hungary on Tuesday closed its southern border with Serbia and hold those who tried to its illegal crossings to halt the influx of migrants.
On the border chaos, while hundreds of migrants has piled up in a no-man's land and the Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who are stuck for an unknown period of time on a strip of land between two states are those who are fleeing the violence in their native countries, building tents and takes up residence.
But comes the feelings of frustration.
When the helicopter fly over them, migrants are calling "Open Borders together!" and swearing riot unit Hungarian police.
Some the protest are refusing food and water.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was "unacceptable" that refugees were sent back from Hungary, while there are still more coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not only an indirect injury.
Over the next days will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The riots in the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the bloc of 28 states have come up with a common immigration policy on the ongoing meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40 000 people seeking protection in a surprised Italy and Greece and talked with the hope of achieving the eventual agreement next month or by the end of the year, which would be the EU nations have adopted more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, their hopes all this Junior ROTC stuff to Brussels or to its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions to give authorities greater powers to tackle the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases dealing with asylum.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter said that his country also plans to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are seeking to move across the country, as is now completed fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported work that even prisoners have been on the list of those who helped pull the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary became the main weakness and the entry point into the European Union for the refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
The Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants, who are looking for a better life and no war refugees who seek protection, which is a look that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise breaches of the 4-foot fence, which the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for a longer period of time in jail for those who illegally transferred refugees.
"This situation caused by mass migration of the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city.
In this, we have a very clear: illegal border crossings is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which is expected in the next week, but the Associated Press reporters watched on the border of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban for home defense consultant, said that the authority was caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 have been caught on the national territory.
They have penetrated by damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Officials quickly left the fence fixed.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a trailer covered in barbed wire.
On the main border crossing at Roszke created chaos, because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing, and a crowd of people.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, when they refused food and water until they would not be allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Head start Hillary Clinton before Bernie Sanders has fallen by half in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the race for Democratic Convention nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her head start.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will want to become president, gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competition, the most democratic voters argue that it is too early to say that they are clearly a decision about which candidate they support.
But Clinton backers are more confident in his selection, than those who are supporting other candidates.
A CBS News poll from last month, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders several gained.
Clinton retains a big lead among women and eases, but its lead is narrowing.
Her support among men is significantly reduced and Sanders at her losing only 5 points.
The advantage of Clinton with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated, and now with Sanders are created equal.
Clinton but still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Sanders had seen double-digit lead over Clinton among liberals, but now at her Sanders loses in this group only 5 points.
About half of Democratic primary voters in the United States say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if he became the nominee of the party.
A quarter would have supported it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would only encourage her for it, that is a candidate.
Six percent would not encourage it.
Perhaps it's no surprise that are current přivrženci Clinton because of her particular passion.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically supported her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically supported Clinton, less Republican voters say the same thing about his the frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When they are supporters of Clinton asked in an open question as to why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed by, that's the time has come for a president's wife (13 percent), and he is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Supporters of Clinton also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It also is quoted a big choice election and consensus on the issues.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidacy for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to face - a third think they would not run.
When Democratic primary voters were asked who would be chosen as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among the supporters of Clinton said more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to stand for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will spread of 20 points, when Biden will run on 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; but this number dropped from 78 percent from last month.
Biden is on this scale far second, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného, is increasing.
However, when it came to the question of greater importance of the candidate, Democrat voters prefer solving a greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, even one Democratic candidate or potential candidate does not act as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, they have good results in some of the key characteristics among primary voters of his party.
Most sees Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and they think that they have a strong leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much than those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent on it doesn't have this view.
Democratic primary voters also generally sees that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological views.
As regards all of these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters at Sanders has no opinion.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email server and as secretary of state continue, most of the Democratic primary electorate is satisfied with the explanation of this matter, and they say that their overall view of her has not affected at all.
But among the American public, it is a different story.
Half of Americans is now with her explanation of dissatisfied, while only about one-third are satisfied.
The views of the public on this subject were distributed in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans say that the email controversy has no impact on their overall view of Clinton, compared with 36 percent of their thoughts on Clinton's health deteriorated.
It's all about the Republicans, where there are more than 6 in 10 said their opinion of Clinton's health deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among voters of her party, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: just 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, a decrease of eight points from last month, and about 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think that is honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested in honesty is best led Biden, Carson and Bush.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters, not opinion on him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up for Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is closer to Donald Trump in the latest survey by CBS News / New York Times
The two candidates are responsible for half of voters in the latest survey, and others are looking for support.
Voters from the ranks of Republicans across the country continue to support the Trump overwhelmingly, and climbed up from 23 per cent support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the debate Fox News last month, at 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson in the same period from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that a Carson leads friends across demographic groups, and excludes Trump between Ivy League educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasiche, is behind a token Governor Scott Walker together in the gallery of the 10% support fell to the current 2%.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and the Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with a 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus or minus 6% and held in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, published last week, showed that Carson to mend his ways and reached 19% support among Republicans for Trump 32% support.
The latest survey from the ABC News / Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In a rising trend of Carson decided to Trump to fire blindly to retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning about the much publicized faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity indicted on the death of a first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during a fraternal přetěžovacího ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, was filed murder charges against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College fraternity Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun's "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
The police claims that he was blindfolded, was wearing a backpack full of sand with a total of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed while trying to reach a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then slipped into unconsciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity didn't call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and allegedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, police said.
However, they have found the time change, Deng Wol's dress, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, national president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, Police Chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide the gear and basically gave priority to the well-being of brotherhood from a life of Michael Deng," said chief Wagner.
We were unable to revive him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report was Deng opakovatelně hit in the head with blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families it was due to overloading in bratrstvích and at least one student die every year because of congestion since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family say, Dengue, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must take responsibility and this step is important from the authorities.
Monroe County grand jury recommended the charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, is also accused of assault by taxing and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only the person concerned, but in the event that there is an organization that is approved, whether officially or unofficially, we'll make them accountable as well," Wagner said at the press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and national fraternity has suspended its relationship with local branches.
This the tents, when the Fed raises interest rates
Growth rates comes and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy slides into recession.
This all we know.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it will take.
For the economy, in particular, offers a history of the designer about timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted six months.
Aggressive rate increases in the Federal Reserve is often, though not always, in determining how the economy and financial assets to respond.
That is why the US Federal Reserve officials stressed so strongly that investors would not be focused on when to start raising rates, but rather the trajectory, how long will it take to standardisation.
In the game is actually more variables.
However, in the end, may become members of the market to make sure that all the fuss over an increase in speed may be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of cheap money, '" he said in a note to clients Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
By contrast, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low, creates a seismic shock, which many fear might be.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how they will respond to certain areas of the economy, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in the last month, is expected to make the air a bit volatile rate increases.
Once but increasing occurs, the effect won't be as dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for re-stopping shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what happens after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market for roughly the past 35 years, often the most - about 14 percent - is going to increase rates in a relatively flat in 250 days (the average growth rate of 2.6 percent), and then returned to normal after the expiry of the 500 days, with the average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis of the Bob, chief equity strategist society Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate increases and return is starting to decline.
The recession is the fact of economic life, but an increase in rates often help her.
Currently, the Fed is facing some of the conditions that have existed and that could hasten a recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point in the history of the Fed's rate increases.
According to Deutsche Bank was during 118 rate hikes since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent year-on-year increase.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect to sustain it, when in the third quarter was the only 1.5 percent, the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this difficult economic backdrop could be risky and could affect the question of "whether this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were prepared for the Fed's growth all year and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could at this meeting to approve the increase, the future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study, since 1950 were all zvyšovací cycles so far in the super-cycle of increasing leverage that concealed the recession with GDP peaks very quickly after the recovery," it says in a report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those, when the Fed expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we have to 74 months and still continue.
Strong revenue was also volatile, because the market is expected to increase rates and the model is somewhat similar to what they're experiencing shares.
The main difference is that it is more noticeable impact on bonds than shares, when the Fed will change the course of politics.
For bonds, it seems that the yields are changing direction immediately after the first arrival cycle, increase / decrease.
At the end of the cycle of rising bond yields fall immediately, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab's policymakers are more likely to believe that an increase in rates will cause approach yields between both long and short-dated bonds, which unfolds curve.
high-yield bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still cautious about the tightening of revenue," stated in its analysis, Kathy Jones, fixed, fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
What's interesting is that Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are few signs that the market is adjusting to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, if the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, the company, which carry out most of its business in the US, the win after an increase in interest rates and the local products will become more attractive.
Nadnárodním companies with a lot of debt, will be worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the space of the world market and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to outperform over the three months after the initial increase in rates," said analysts Goldman Sachsve in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets ahead of weak balance sheet of the company in any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, at an average of about 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as with stocks with low volatility, also were outperforming their counterparts lower quality (an average of 4 percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside the purely stock games are benefiting consumers also thanks to the rising dollar.
also Spořitelé may see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3's copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "numbing"
It takes the view that is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals
They also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says that just cheat the Brits
A colleague Damian Collins attacked the Voice and says he is not the original idea
BBC Radio 3's "change" in the Classic FM, says a leading MP and accumulating fresh pressure on broadcasters to demonstrate that they are doing something that commercial broadcasters are doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station seems to be "ohlupována" and is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word" ohlupováno "- but it seems that is changing on Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year appears to be the British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind, when in fact only simulating what we already have in the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC denied the charges on the grounds that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3, I would in any other radio taught.
And their commitment to live music and making music is, in fact, at the top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and entry into new works in service is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, the regulator argued the BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey, that is now needed to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the production of the BBC, which has come under fire for treading on the toes of the commercial competitors during the broadcast of the Culture, Media and Sports and they came to the committee hearing.
The Conservative MP Damian Collins attacked - the musical talent show The Voice, which he bought from a Dutch producer at BBC Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
You can see why on this programme discussed as caused by non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which September stars Paloma Faith aBoy George as judges - was made "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants to "find a hit from the Corporation's own stables" when it's time to start an entertaining series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future seasons of the show The Voice or spending money taxpayers royalties on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of the year 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month was recorded the lowest growth since 2000, began the records
Internet sales have been strengthened three years ago thanks to a mobile shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November could be the reason for the braking spending
More than a decade has been a virtual shopping on the rise, and thanks to him, from many British high streets became a ghost town.
However, experts say there are signs of stabilisation, online sales, and the new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of the year 2015.
The total spending for August represented the lowest growth since the beginning of the year 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared with the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs of stabilisation, online sales, and the new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of the year 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the past years and going back to the year 2000, always to rationalise the status quo over time," reports for the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the index of sales IMRG.
He explains that the Internet sales have been strengthened three years ago, when customers started using their mobile phones to carry out the purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online, and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
Now, but rather is stagnating (growth), and therefore appears to be bottoming out.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers delay purchases before the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the last year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers, to make a shopping and dropped a few websites vendors.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which lets shoppers bargain again, may keep customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 in every £5 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, is more than a third of sales made through a web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buying clothes and shoes online, instead shopping at brick-and-mortar fashion stores.

The newly manufactured and used exclusively not roasted sesame oil and white sesame seeds.
In an hour can handle our press press 8 pounds sesame.

In this designation owes much to the highest levels of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids your body's ability to produce itself and the person is must receive from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
The study scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that daily intake of the substance is inadequate.

Behind not even the Czechs.
Based on surveys of the market, we find that only 4% of the people in my life negrilovala.
The vast majority of then grill and several times a year.
In order to be a successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - the ideal is to adjust the meat marinate several hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the most appropriate and at the same time, at a barbecue leaves wholesome substances?
In general, in the process of barbecue should save fat.
Experts agree that much of the oil begins at high temperatures to lose its taste.

Grape oil for a barbecue, health and beauty.
When we say meat, experts from the firm Bohemia Oil from the grape seed oil comes immediately to mind.
Wonderfully, adds a taste of meats and fish.
The kitchen has a unique characteristics of the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying, grilling, because it has a high degree of combustion, to 216 ° C.
Even at such a high temperature, then, as one of the few oil keeps wholesome substances, describes the benefits of oil Daniel from the firm Bohemia Oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of oil from the vine.
Experts agree that grape seed oil is 50 times more potent than vitamin E and 20 times more potent than vitamin C.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid, and is effective in fighting with excess cholesterol.

Chefs the use of oil in the kitchen.
Not only is suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, such as flavoring salads, but also to cook meals.
In a barbecue, therefore, can use now in two ways, by marinating and the barbecue.
Marinováním meat and fish we maintain their succulence.
In preparing the marinade must be present three components: oil, acidity and spice.
Acidity cider vinegar, for example, and that we will deliver a softening of the meat.
Spices, in turn, gives the meat taste and oil perpetuates and adds savor, advises Daniel.
At the same time, adds that the grape seed oil is ideal for marinating because, as one of the few oils can penetrate through the dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are ready for a barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin olive oil are characterised by the fact that to prepare meals, there's only a few drops.
The same is true for a barbecue.
Some oil are for this way of preparing the absolute taboo.
It's especially flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be at all warmed up.
Before the barbecue grill smear oil, prevent met Zack food.
An essential part of the barbecue is also preparing annexes.
To your grilled meat and fish are virtually anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light green salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, hot summer salad.
To him, you need: • 1 pack peaches • 1 bunch arugula • 1 cup diced cucumber • 1 cup of mixed salad leaves • 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
By salad bowl, add to the mix their own arugula salad leaves, sliced cucumbers and a large cubes sliced peach.

At the conclusion of a few drops of oil.
For exceptional taste salad, then you can sprinkle finely sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: not just on drugs, but also on the patient's willingness to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complex disease and a person with this diagnosis needs care of a number of experts: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, ergoterapeuta, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
But it's not just about the medical treatment, for example, a woman with multiple sclerosis, also need consultation, if they decide to have a child, to care for these sick include social advice, recommendations in the adaptation of housing, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can have a major effect on the patient.
The more will actively fight with the disease, the longer it can work and does not fundamentally change the style of his life.
As a point doctors, passivity of patients making way for the disease activity.
It is, for example, have shown that regular movement significantly delay the time when sick needs some compensation, for example, the staff.
It is important that patients and their surroundings were not subject to various myths, for example, that the disease is automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.
Even so, a site Take a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is backed by the ongoing media campaigns, give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of patients with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis is twice the adage that what starts to treat the disease earlier, the doctor may have more influence.
It's because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage when neurodegenerace process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the chance that we will be able to stop or delay the first disease, explains Dr. Eva Honey from clinics teaching hospital in Prague.
Very important is for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitative care, which often solves the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
With the sick to work, according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improving gait, strengthen the pelvic floor, mitigate swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"It's a very individual, depends on the patient's specific problems," says Dr. Martin Request, the rehabilitation and medicine in the hospital.
People with multiple sclerosis may suffer from the same disease, but for each expressed in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can stop the disease, but always can alleviate her symptoms.
activity but also strengthens the immune status of the organism, which is in the case of multiple sclerosis is desirable.
Another regular exercise is the fact that you're sick verify what they can do, and it strengthens their confidence.
"The exercise will also wash endorphins and man after it feels good," points out, Camilla Řasová of medicine by the hospital.
By that would affect the physical side, we are working on the limbic system responsible for emotion.
Right now we are interfering in the psyche and immune processes and disease stabilize, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were saving, so to speak, we now know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof.. Els, rehabilitation and medicine in the hospital.
The physical therapy is so that people can stay as long as self-sufficient, and that includes the work of inclusion.
Therefore will cooperate with ergoterapeuty to every person received compensation tool suited him at peace.
Many patients' needs and care a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When you come into the life of a serious illness, the majority of people it will shake.
They take a shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a major burden - the loss of health.
With such agonized soul we have for someone to go, rather than trying to kidnap everything on his shoulders.
"I've been working with them to finally come to the conclusion that even with disabilities can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malina - Schubert of Neurological clinics teaching hospital in Prague.
Without the manufacturer Airbus Latecoere would fly.
The production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new planes are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which so anyone can produce and process.
Yet it can be next to superpřesných, computerized machine tool, alongside the autoclaves for molding composites to stumble upon something as simple as those apricot pits.
In the drum, which resembles a pot of cotton candy, in a pile of stones to reiterate the edges of the sheet metal parts, which just came from frézovacího machines.
"So far, nobody has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan, CEO of the manufacturer air door Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the grounds in previous Letov manufactures complete door for the Airbus A320.
As the only people in the world are delivering the door for Brazil's Embraer 170.
Through the door, part of which is drawn up in Prague, also enter into first and upper-class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380.
They are here, and the door full composites for new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
The key moment is leaving the company to adjust twice a year.
If the yellow sticker missed a record of inspection, they should be in the race to explain what auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who drive regularly to check if the doors are produced in accordance with the agreed rules.
The human senses but advanced technology has yet to completely replace.
On one door into the A320 is 1,500 rivets.
You must manually nýtaři shakes.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of hammers will know if it is properly rivet shaking.
Tolerance, in which they move, is minimal.
Nýt can perform above the surface of the planes from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That is roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
The review comes at a number of trained touch.
When the comptroller slides a finger along the line of rivets, gets to know if any of them out of tolerance.
Only then will take up the exact úchylkoměr.
Letov nurtured a year ago 1989 program the military aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, has already made one.
The company had to quickly find a new contract.
Back then, together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the supplier emergency door for model A321.
Courtship with Boeing were not so lucky.
"We were for them, then a small company, which did not have enough money for investment and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supply," he recalls.
The door to the US producers would remain closed, if Letov in 1999, delivered at a conference of international aviation industry association of French group Latecoere.
I was talking about our collaboration with Airbus.
The next day started negotiations with the French, he says.
A year later, the Czech firm Latecoere bought and with a strong companies came new contracts.
We started in 2000, the assembly of parts of the door for the A320.
Three years later, the door of the upper deck for the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new plant for processing composites for supplies for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere we ourselves to these big contracts.
Maybe we were doing small parts or components.
The partners want to guarantee supplies for 20 or 30 years, explains.
Last year, Czech Latecoere reached over 2.9 billion turnover and profit after tax of 147 million.
Exclusive position between suppliers aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000, has invested $1.5 billion.
The firm must have quality certificates, certification 170 special production processes and passes on the qualifications for key personnel.
Without them, the company would no doors into the aircraft manufactured.
Getting certificates that manufacturing processes to comply with the requirements of customers, and in multiple checks, is to keep costs under Dubského million.
The manufacturing processes are changing every year.
They are more accurate and more stringent.
We need doškolovat staff, equipment and be retrofitted to certify the whole process again, he adds.
Now the company is completing the preparation process for coating in zinc and nickel, which will replace a cadmium harmful to human health.
The award was received from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for the device or chemicals that are used in Prague.
People are coming from Boeing, will test the concept of the lines.
Then they produce the show.
They'll review and our laboratory.
One set of samples to test themselves in his lab and then the results compared with our, Dubský closer to the way in which the customers control.
The prize is the company's long-term exclusive contracts.
With the race now stands or falls embraerů production.
For A320 produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replace the Czech Latecoere for Brazilian or European manufacturer is either impossible or very difficult.
However, this does not mean that he could tell the door at any price.
Part of the contract is price curve.
That shows how much they will become one door after ten, fifty, a hundred pieces produced.
The price for a piece still dropping to a certain limit value.
By this price formula, we need to come.
If not, we will lose business, he says.
Half of the lobby, where electrical closet for a military aircraft Airbus A400 M, is not yet clear.
It is, however, a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen here is building a new polorobotická riveting and assembly line on the door for upgraded model of the A320 Neo.
Riveting accelerates and workable.
"This is a trend, which is fitting in aviation is going," he adds.
Distribution has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of a new model of the A320.
Just a few metres beside a line to complete the installation of the door for the upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten the time of production and reduce costs.
The full assembly could begin within two years, he says.
Before that, however, the company must go through the qualification tests required for the assembly of electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is betting on further development of the manufacture of composite materials.
In addition to the Boeing should participate in the new programme, the Airbus A350, which will compete with the US.
"For a company that is a huge credit when you can do except metal materials and composites processing," he says proudly.
However, Latecoere in the Czech Republic is on the edge of production capacity.
In Letov campus, where, for another place isn't.
Before the entry into force of the French mothers had the company's 180 employees.
Now it has 800 and within three years, there could be even about a hundred more.
As long as the Airbus and Boeing compete to see how many hundreds of new aircraft, the airline call every year, need not have worried about the work.
Although it has a contract for several years to come, the parent company of the Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September loan repayments.
Finally, Latecoere could finish with major creditors.
At the end of August, part of the loans in exchange for shares.
Lenders have gained in the company capital increase of 57.4 million euros a share 37.4 percent.
Debt firms has fallen by two-thirds, or about $180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company has subscribed to the new shares to existing shareholders at 222,9 million euros.
He raised the share capital of 280 million euros.
The whole group is benefiting from the increasing production of the Airbus and Boeing, who are in sales in 85 percent.
The average growth is expected to contract by four percent a year until 2017.
In the custom book has orders for 2.6 billion euros, equivalent to a four-year production.
The French media claims that Latecoere, finally, after years on the can breathe again.
Czech race in the group is significant.
The sales group contributes 16 percent.
According to the number of employees is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MPs have backed a greater share of the state charges for coal.
The change in charges for the extraction of minerals has to bring into state coffers of 427 million more than in 2013.
On municipal revenue has to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee has to be higher.
In the year gained community of fees of roughly $450 million and the state budget of $150 million.
It was brown coal mining communities about $200 million and State 66 million.

Revenue from these payments has continued to fully belong to municipalities.
Industry Minister John () Members, said that the community because it will gain a year instead of $14 million to 100 million.
The level of mining fees will determine the law, but it sets by government decree.
The payment shall be calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for different kinds of minerals.
According to the government is the reason for the change, among others, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
Thu but warned that setting the fee by Government regulation may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to the minister, in this case, however, it is not a tax because the state it is levied on mineral, which is state property.
The fees are only community, whose territory are affected by mining.
In the case of coal will get three-quarters of the money the community and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be even in the case of mining radioactive rocks.
Part of the money, which the state on charges of mining picks will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the mining or to ensure the safety of the service.
The draft today criticized the opposition MPs, who argued in particular that damaged communities affected by mining and districts.
For example, Michal Kučera (the top 09 and) warned that mining companies are no longer want to sponsor community as before, because they pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible for one of the world's poorest regions, only to have Mr. Finance Minister budget," said David (Dawn) elected in the county.
A rise in unemployment on the Hana Aulická MP has warned.
Aulická and unsuccessfully proposed an amendment rejected, he wanted to return the government to.
The statement says that according to the mining companies to increase fees into the price of coal, because prices are more than 90 percent of long-term contracted.
The main consumers like power plants or CHP would therefore shouldn't feel the price growth.
"On the other hand, this really increases the risk that the mining organisations will increase in payments to compensate for efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which would essentially mean a reduction in the number of employees," admits the government.
According to her, however, is an increase in fees in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur to's of Urbana () is key to MPs, before the law knew the conclusions on the updated energy concept, and most importantly, the government's decision to cap coal mining.
If coal will also benefit for the limits, then it will have an impact on revenue for the state and municipalities, pointed out.
Urban Mládkem disagrees with that decision on breaking the limit on the bottom of the army should fall until after 2020.
Limits on the bottom, he says, should break for social reasons, and because of the long-term stability of the economy at large domestic energy.
Time for a decision on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching how the US Federal Reserve is preparing to meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision about whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The survey of 80 economists by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve will make a decision now think that remain dormant for some time and keep interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event, because he sat years have passed since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are moving closer to a situation where the central bank would be able to get out of the bar and begin the process of normalization of zero interest rates, "says Angel Ubide, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, there has been a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the State account and only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets in order to be ready to increase, but the circumstances suggest that also sees a chance against this step.
The decision is expected to be announced on Thursday, 20: 00 CET.
The shooter left a message on the Delta State University
Shannon Lamb, who on Monday had shot his girlfriend in Mississippi - and later the same day and his colleague - wrote a message in which he says he's "sorry" first murder and that he wishes he could take it back, revealed on Tuesday the government offices.
Police in Gautieru in Mississippi reported that Lamb, a geography teacher and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning at about 10: 00
And he said that someone shot.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police to his house.
He said: "Last night I shot his wife" and also mentioned that the house is "cute dog" who "doesn't bother anybody," but he's upset.
The police demanded the names of the caller, but Lamb introduced myself.
Lamb also explained why he had been fired at the house.
When the police arrived on the scene, found the body of Amy 41leté prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, stating: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she is the only person who ever loved me. "
After leaving a message with Lamb embarked on a 300-mile journey to the university Delta, where history teacher killed Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The dean of the College of William La Forge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "in my head of Mr Lamb is obviously something going on."
Despite Monday's declaration that Lamb allegedly believed in a romantic relationship with prentiss Amy Schmidt government authorities reported that a "love triangle" there is "no evidence."
Shawn O Steen, who was married with Prentiss over seven years, he said that he was "a great person."
The divorce was 15 years ago, but both remain friends.
19-year-old daughter O Steen and prentiss was the case was "shaken."
O Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, Lamb had dated for about three years.
"I always wanted to help others," let's hear Knowles.
The police said that Lamb on Monday spoke with their relatives and said that he "will not go to jail."
When police caught up with him on a highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran off into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to the biography, which was published on the Web site of the school, Lamb was awarded a doctorate in the field of education at the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months out of the game because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left fullback this injury left in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive, and he thinks Shaw would be able to play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless crackdown Héctora Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw pushed his way into space PSV.
Nine minutes later he was treated on the pitch and was also needed oxygen mask before he was taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double fracture of the leg, and is now in the hospital."
It will be taken tomorrow or maybe the next day and then further surgery in Manchester.
It's awful - the boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very difficult, but I played fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture of the leg will take six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I believe that he still to play this season.
Moreno was very lucky that didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli Mexican punish.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for themselves whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly crackdown with both feet.
A tweet from the account Shaw says: "Thank you everyone for their messages, words cannot express how I ruined, my road to recovery begins now and come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United have seen injured Luke Shaw in the defeat against PSV
The English defender will have an added incentive to recovery in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, coach of PSV, said: "It was a very nasty injuries."
If any player off the field with such injuries, each of which is very sad.
It is not the goal of our players to injure opponents.
Moreno had suffered a broken leg in the struggle for Mexico against Van Holland at the World Cup 2014.
"It's very hard for him because his intention was not to hurt opponents, and when you hear about the severity of the injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I just saw the ball, which was heading in the other direction, so it seemed to touch him [Moreno], but I haven't seen crackdown on Luke.
In an interview for the SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
The player PSV Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after surgery Chris Smallinga.
David Cameron certainly knows The the Lorax better?
This one thing every parent knows: if your child falls in love with a book, it's not long before she learns almost by heart.
That, however, may not be David Cameron.
On the question of the service providers of children's schedules to appoint the popular children's book, the Prime Minister chose the Lorax, fable from Dr Seuss in 1971.
It was difficult to choose, writes Cameron, in a report published on the website society SuperCamps and continues: "Funny, touching, and with a strong creative content, so I like to read to their children, because it was always a painting or a message that I haven't seen before."
Well, except that in the next paragraph Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book, according to the elevator from the film of 2012, which added another figures and details, filed a brief original text.
"In the city Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by failing to fulfil her wish to see a real tree," is a brief the contents of the book, which is the object of love unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that weren't enough, the suspects, text supplied Cameron summary reads like a film, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and starts with the words: "In the city Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes that gets to the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron had not met with the plot of the book, where the unnamed young man learns that the local nature devastates the greedy, trees kácející industrialista Once-reading, which, despite the protests of the The Lorax, crouched, a creature who "speaks for the trees."
In all likelihood, so relatively few major PR task got sidekick, who never read the Lorax child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for Downing Street said that the text probably came from the office of Cameron's.
SuperCamps confirmed that an employee of Cameron's text, but had no further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of omission of England, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England selected for this tour, I think it will be a rerun of the 3-0 defeat suffered by the other day in the Test series, not very likely.
I also would not rule out straight win guests.
Page Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there is good players spin in the batting lineup, and also the collective mentality is strong; bear the scars of 2012, only the youthful positivity.
With the ball is emerging spinner Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, even when it is unknown at the level of the Test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the England team experienced in the series and was replaced by Alex Halesem.
The decision to omit Adam Lytha for me is a tough nut to crack for analysis, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests cost against two good attacks in demanding conditions and simple, but the harsh reality is that the cricketers are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, around the names of Joe Root were no question marks, which led to the announcement, because - and this, as I mentioned earlier - players are their best atribute.
A few other half-century and Lyth could extend their series, but should have control of their own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The England coach, Trevor Bayliss, praising his position, although his performances have not been entirely foolproof, and it doesn't surprise me; it was always a team player.
The question of how much the test of time gets batsman to show, is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps - as well as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton has won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing that you could gripe is that England has given the first chance in the Caribbean Jonathan Lyth Trottovi - even though he was in the best form - but this is a wasted opportunity is in the past.
Here's Alex Hales and it is a batsman, who very positively.
It's x-factor cricketer, whom we have seen here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he gained 236 against us on the field at Trent Bridge, which kind of made.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity that got his predecessors, but all of this, of course, will depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when Moeen starts alongside Cook, who would get an extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been raised and I'm not against her reservations.
I don't understand why strokemaker cannot bat and the left-handed man has already shown he is a wonderful cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was 3 for them and it's not a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played the first of its first 38 tests ahead of his performances in 2001.
Immediately he didn't three centuries and never looked back.
The team comes Zafar Ansari as reserve spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, struck me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at the raw statistics - an average of 31 with bat and 35 with the ball - and see it as a punt, but not a lot of spinnerů, who raised their hands, and selektoři opted for youth.
There's a lot of that on this tour.
In addition to the team, it seems that England has made a few changes and smart additions to their the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, batsmen from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches can be a masterstroke.
He is one of the most beautifully playing guys who will bring a wealth of experience that have experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the tour, white-ball and will bring to the team as energy, so ruthless spark.
I've always felt that he was born into a world of international cricket, either as a player or a coach, and as well as Mahela has the intellect, which can be used.
The new voices in the dressing room, even if it is the consistent voices saying things that have been said before, may occasionally lighten and freshen up the atmosphere.
Bandmate Collyho Durham Ben Stokes got the day off, as well as Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.
Even if they disagree on how many, many coaches and selektoři do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The campaign Brexit would win, if the economy starts to stagnate until 2017.
Ill-advised David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into the other problems with each passing day, even without the election of Jeremy's "It's a Yes or No?" Corbyn at the head of the Workers Party, or will you take "TUC on Tuesday on the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners also have their Faragese Corbyna and Nigel.
A close friend of European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in the various crises - which are not all their fault - some Member States have had enough of the British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes the treaty, which usually wouldn't.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, "TUC has decided that it will not even have weakened social protection.
We can even call it a selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attends summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, will take a picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then returned to the home with words that are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to wear the nezahleděnou Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities to get to the point where we left them on the matter.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, carefully balanced, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his post, before it becomes wrong, as was the case for too long, continuous Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl's (16).
The Frenchman François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power also is waning.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right-hand side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how to help break the legs in a selfie Britons who could better to invest his energy to prevent Scotland's departure from the UK - which is something they don't want, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these may be planning ministers deliberately unhelpful comments style SNP during the referendum campaign 2017 in Great Britain, to hasten the process of Brexit, says a friend.
"The re-negotiations to solve the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value of negotiations."
Europeans to their own detriment knows how ferocious Fleet Street can be and how the EU are skeptical of the oligarchs press barons, because they were inspired by Tony Benn during the referendum in 1975, which has supported our entry in 1973 in a 2: 1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, a cunning Euro-opportunist who has made his name as the EU's Brussels correspondent "straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite their vanity Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of taxes, foreigners hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned the majority of the major newspapers.
In fact, some of them Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he realized that when you're in a cage with the gorilla, you have to throw bananas to give you to dinner and then also to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than the Blair, said Cameron's referendové routine, since Blair accepted the principle of the EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and has earned him a card being fired.
The press never forgave him, too.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday at Westminster in a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he must not waste time on me - seems to be in danger of re-embrace the strategy of boycotting Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy involving the media, not to me, but certainly with Andrew - Marr, whose seat at the BBC on Sunday left.
Corbin's official stance on Europe is, I'll say it nice, evolving.
He claims that he would like to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the frantic tendency of Ukip and wild shores of Tory's small Englanderismu can certainly agree to it.
The same said Hilary Bemm "but not" Benniite Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner Boy Scout couldn't bring himself to admit that McDonnell abrazivního Corbynovo appointment as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his grandfather fought on television about his loyalty, without going too far and lost his job.
The Hillary was much more attractive.
But the fight for it to remain "under any circumstances" - Bennina phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC said colleagues and members of their private meeting on Monday night.
Whether it's the background of any kind, sensitive image, which wants to convey Corbyn - remember, he touched me - discipline remains important in the ages of the day's news broadcasting and particularly in faith, swinging hotbed of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
It is fair to Cameron not to provide a free ticket to Europe, which would have allowed him to consider supporting the Workers Party in referendové campaign for granted, as noted by McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But Corbynovo McDonnellovo and basic equivocation about EU membership - in accordance with their Bennite facing the economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is the central point of the doctrinal bickering.
Just as with his equivocation on Nato - Tom Watson is confident that it will not want to terminate the campaign JC - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their domestic masters.
Why should the Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - are also suspicious electorate - concessions for Britain, though it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the performance of "weak by the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and even in reducing the cost of the conservative government in power, as I noted at the start of what was called The Security Forum British influence.
Experts have criticized the review of electronic published by Public Health England
The statement by the government-funded agency that about 95% of e-cigarettes are safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links with the tobacco industry, claim researchers.
The experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticism of evidence used in its report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (However).
However, the agency released a report last month mezníkovou "" and described it as a "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers call into question the robustness of the data and draw attention to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy base," on which the agency However based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write in the BMJ, disputed the claim, which was supposedly "built on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They indicate that the public might expect that the agency's assertion However, which reads "current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting convened by 12 people to develop a multi-criteria analysis decision Assets (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell alleges that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly has previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.
He also approved the appointment of public health BAT in sustainability report states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but no funding, which allegedly received earlier from a tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for the selection of the members of the panel is not available, but contain a number of well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also claim in the newspaper industry funding.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for its expertise in the fight against smoking.
However, also attended the meeting in tobacco control.
The report generated in this group, "eloquently admits," missing "hard evidence about the harmfulness of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or However is not described in the report.
McKee and Capewell said that However assertion that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing in However, argued that the allegations in the BMJ has already been answered before.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One of two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the public health risk posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
However, it has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and also what displayed, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative risk compared with tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die from diseases associated with smoking and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
The clear by highlighting the current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not without risk, carrying only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking -- we fill our national competence.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4
The former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should cease to broadcast programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "put right hand" behind hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programs that are not made of other British television broadcasting.
He criticised the BBC for failing to put on public service programs, which is likely to see only a handful of people in difficult times, compared with its rivals' highest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the director general Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried, without success, to connect with the BBC for six years, which worked on Channel 4.
"I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC commissioning and sends the programs that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson said in the Commission for communication in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you can keep your license fees, which I'm not sure whether they are in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce the formation, at least in terms of the programs, which also produces or is not included.
They're The Voice in prime time, because they want to get the broadest possible support into the future.
The idea that no one else would it even aired, is a funny joke, and, of course, absurd.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be financed bezpříspěvkově.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders next, and, of course, produced on home soil.
Honestly other channels would be easy for them right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting service.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a businessman in the series, which led the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that they feel guilty that drove ratings "because of the ambition of the people who worked here, and because he believed that it is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comment about the most popular show on the BBC repeats those that former Sky executive director, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that the BBC will sell a show like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's public service programmes hýčkanější "passes on BBC4, where quite often cannot be measured audience, but fill its power and may argue, as are gearing up for its mission to justify the £4bn hypocritical income from royalties," But, of course, we're doing all of these obscure programs, in which no one was watching. "
They're sending them at a time when no one was looking at them.
In terms of the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find regresivnější system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds per year is a big sum, but for the people, for whom it is £150 a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at the BBC.
Former head of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its reithovskou mission within the meaning of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that a small amount of production of the BBC was previously classified as an educational now - it used to be 1% of TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take a model of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada, and change is to "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the subject of partnership Elstein said that the BBC should be doing more in areas such as the Proms, which was broadcast on television only a handful, and connect with commercial reporters, so we could see them all online.
"Sonogenetika" or "control brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses influencing the direction in which the nematodes are moving.
Scientists raised the worms with genetically modified nervous system, which can control the sound waves.
The tiny nematodes changing direction at a time when they are hit by audio impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work so that they switch cells genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write down brain activity using light
Scientists have said that these worms are a great example of the new methodology called sonogenetika that uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activate the outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the newspaper Guardian that this method might one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure, in which they are added to the patient's brain electrodes to stimulate the brain. The method is used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, for example.
Nematodes usually do not respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that reaction will come when it is placed into a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As found bubbles are intensifying ultrasonic waves, which then passes through the body of a worm.
Intensified ultrasonic waves operate in TRP ion channels-4, which is located in the membranes of cells worms.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells, which are connected, reported in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms, so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP ion channels-4.
When used in this way then modified worms ultrasound, sound waves were amplified mikrobublinami and carried over into worms, where they switched on modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetice, groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off the neurons with light.
Chalasani, but left to hear that sonogenetika could have many advantages compared with this technology.
Unlike the lights, which must be postmarked by fibre to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can focus on human neurons and make them susceptible to temporarily ultrasonic signals in clinical treatment used to treat neurological disease," Chalasani said.
He added that his application would have found the method to treat muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
The illegal torture device - right on your doorstep.
Advertisements embarrassing British arms trade.
Look at the video of the market from Amnesty International.
Menacing genocidal drones!
The shackles on his legs, which breaking ankles.
Shatter missiles.
And the electric stun batons, which cause excruciating pain, but they don't leave no trace.
A cheerful voice and caricature metaphors leaves no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fairs is sharp parody created for Amnesty International for the highlight of the British government's willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes across the Defence and Security Equipment International (SINGING) Hambone at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

One of the advertising a parody produced the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindona, curator of Designs Cruel and an assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly challenging political activity and trying to show viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists set to work with activists in the protest movement, and they realize that they must get out there in the real world, their art to have an impact on society.

Eight golden rules for life on a student dorm
11 years ago, I moved to the college as a 19-year-old kid oblivious, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but until now I recall strained smiles of those whom I resented - and multiple, lengthy complaints on the other.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on to the tracks can range from a slightly irritating running after totally appalling.
It is tempting to babble: to tell people where you're from, if you took a year off, how you feel about love Corbyna and why "frankly not just hate Marmite, because people, it is only in yeast extract, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help the others to take a deep breath - just ask and also an expression of interest.
He runs the conversation and help you find the people you love, and those with whom you would not have fun even if your eyelashes were on fire, and they would pose a fire extinguisher.
Let people space.
The rooms are often change on drinking reception, the movie nights and municipal public places, but it's also a room where people dress up and adjusting their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about the fact that you started to go to college and be in a relationship
high they come up short.
Your room should be a sanctuary, yet many tracks changes in walking mimopokojovou culture, which is a friendly, outgoing and contributes to a lifelong friendship.
It can be hard for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture doesn't allow you to say, "I love you, and I want to continue our friendship, but I need to go away, so I can get back to the energy I used up in conversation with you."
Try to know when a classmate tired of socialization - and maybe he write instead of knocking.
Speaking of a knock, knock.
One boy in my dorm was in the habit of that, if the doors are locked, is invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
Because you start to go to university at the top of the baking mania, knocking on doors and performance with plate upečenými cookies seems slightly less weird, less than the "Welcome to the neighbourhood, something I made you, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering domestic delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommate will feel obliged to speak with you, and maybe all ends so that your face will be assigned to the succulent surprises.
That, of course, is the subject of this that you are a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and probably lead jams that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime on college campuses.
The theft of the chicken, of course, is a crime, but it is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Double-check with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that your milk will offer even when they go on a rampage inside.
If someone steals something, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate who switched their milk for a dishwashing liquid to punish thieves.
Now he is in prison.
You shouldn't make noises that distracts people from their sleep or studio.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you are also known for people in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked his neighbors, if they could keep it down and bass, because they were 3 at night and in the morning was a test.
Their answer was the music.
When he finally fell silent at 5 o'clock in the morning, let them sleep two hours and then set up his own music, locked the door and went on a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic, if your future husband went to the same college as you?
And vice versa, it would not be terribly embarrassing if you have the wrong roommate for his future wife, slept together, break up and they had to see each other every day, and it might also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if your sexy roommate isn't 100 percent of your future spouse, try at least a little talk with their weaknesses.
In the sublime moment when you realise that someone had left the keys in an unlocked room, there's a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable lesson about their security and fun by giving them something to hide - never don't ruin someone's room toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and give them the keys to a bottle of water, which is then put into the freezer - but they never leave their belongings on the ceiling, more than twice.
Eva, the twins forward despite an uncertain future.
Eva's been through some tough times already in pregnancy with the seven-year-old today.
His father broke up with her, and to prepare and raising a child was alone.
With the situations I cope relatively quickly - I'm very much looking forward to the child and I was looking at the positives.
Uncertainty and by being alone with the baby, I tried to stop beating yourself up.
And I certainly had the hope that we don't stay long themselves, Eva recalls today on her first pregnancy.
Since then she met on the Internet in a chat room, a senior, with whom she started talking about favorite movies.
Vasek Eve with even brought home from the hospital, but in the role of my stepfather, too.
"For a while, then withdrew from the program," described Eva in a documentary series, "Four in the 3.
The motive of the third series of the TV series is just the pursuit of happiness at the second attempt.
They also have the financial security of families cope with a part-time job and a lot of help from his mother and aunt of a bailout.
Not even the prospect of responsibility for foreign child eventually nepokazily Vaškovu attachment to Eva.
We definitely got together round of second birthday, and he now understands, like his dad and also speaks to him.
Even though he already has two adult daughters, fatherhood at 60, according to their words used, and children are also more dedicated.
In addition to the two-year-old Leontýnka was added to them and ultimately the twins.
"into our family, so naturally, perhaps by the fact that my mother never spoke much in relations," they think smiling Eva.
Few places?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and El was born by caesarean section after Eve at the end of pregnancy was diagnosed with cholestasis.
This is a disorder of production and activity of bile acids, which are then in excessive quantities are found in the blood of pregnant and in particular the itching.
The illness is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which are at risk of premature birth and death, with his mother after childbirth usually resolves spontaneously.
Emma and El Vaškovu to Eva's and happiness were born healthy, even though they were only in the 36th week.
Emičku placed in an incubator at intermediate ward, where he works, and the niece, which made her take over and check in.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer of the ICU room I had it in her possession, describes the difficult period after childbirth Eva.
In the hospital spent 20 days, while doctors have given our permission to release of the babies who had managed to reach the border two pounds.
Waiting for a gain of children in the hospital Eve joy but it didn't.
"I was crazy after her husband and children," recalls a difficult moments on the separation of the mother.
She and her husband, and about signing reversu, among other things, and because of the access to one of the doctors.
To do so, but eventually happened and Eva, even with the twins doctors released into the home care.
Stories of four pregnancies and births sends ČT1 Tuesday night at 9: 45 a.m.
A total of extended family can downsize.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where he had to make do with electrical dvouplotýnkou Eva and crowded conditions.
The house has grown, but it did Eve joy it is mounted a gas stove that was preparing food for six people more comfortable.
When nejůř will, we will take it in turns to a cab.
Eva is convinced that kids today, especially the family's well-being and the atmosphere, and not the size or shabbiness cottage.
In the meantime, we were very good, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space, and we sometimes kutalející with babies, but at least we are all around, smiling Eva, who can find each situation on the positive side.
Labour the lights in the movie is no guarantee of a regular income.
That's why sometimes goes out into the streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60 years, according to their words care about the finances of the family and the children physically, but how long is it going to be?
"I realize that, given our age difference that someday I who will feed this family," admits Evo straight at the prompting of the future.
She would like to go back to work, but even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not very glamorous for employers.
And when the going gets tough, we can share a cab with her husband, joking sympathetic blonde.
Apple suffered a yo-yo effect.
For everything they can display.
More powerful processor, camera with greater resolution, stronger chassis or display of the power of touch, it is in a nutshell the primacy of the recently introduced a ninth-generation iPhones.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
Up to trend of Apple, was that each new generation iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared with the previous,.
Dvougramový weight difference to the detriment of the news was not really negligible.
That, however, for the new iPhones is far from the case.
In contrast to last year, 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model has risen about 14 grams, with bigger then about 20 grams.
On the one hand, we can't blame, last year's affair bending in the pockets of Apple racked up considerably.
The chassis innovation is so resilient aluminium alloy of 7,000, which is also reflected on the weight.
But a much greater impact they have on her display.
Apple has used the technology innovations in 3D Touch, which displays recognize the power of touch.
To do so, it was necessary to provide another layer of capacitive sensor display.
The mass displays of new iPhones as compared to previous generations have increased more than double.
For a smaller iPhone from the original 12 grams of 29 grams, in the case of a larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s on display is the hardest used component.
Masses of only 143 grams is then at this news also achieved thanks to a treadmill, which affected most of the remaining components.
For larger model is then used by the heaviest element of batteries, her weight relative to the predecessors, however, has not changed.
Even in this case is that the biggest increase in evident in the display.
Weight 5.5 "iPhone 6s Plus so reaches 192 grams.
How will the new display technologies practical, to take effect in the application.
The first users will be able to try it as early as Friday, September 25, when it will start selling iPhones in selected countries 6s and 6s Plus.
They are cereal breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Paglicci Grotto Italian archaeologists made the discovery, which opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of modern human habitation here from different times, including the murals of instruments, and so on and so forth.
In layer 23A, which is according to tools dating back to a time before the roughly 30,000 years ago, but scientists have discovered something very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.
On the site, that they found traces of oat grains, which at first glance appears to go through the process of production is now so popular flakes.
In her first grain today get wet, then dried, get rid of the packaging, the so-called scouring, then steamed and do the flat.
In the Paglicci Cave managed to discover the grains, which was apparently nahřáta or spařena, and then probably crushed between a rock and a hard place - at least the telltale signs of taking on two stones in a cave.
Scientists have failed in its publication in the journal PNAS demonstrate that it would be in the cave was a complete production process flakes, but is actually a very striking similarities.
There is also no evidence about how people can eat cereal, but the assumption that it was with some fluid and maybe even warm, of course, offers a completely logically.
At the same time, it's a very interesting proof of how intensely people use cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the snowflake interpretation is correct, the oldest snowflake ahead of agriculture by roughly twenty thousand years.
A new report stations in the House of the city of Brno.
So I listened again to report the names of the stops in: Hnusáčkova, Specter, Frázova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolley was somewhat louder, so reports a man's voice was somewhat less comprehensible than before, when he stops reported a woman's voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so in a deeper traffic noise is more recognizable than a male voice.
While DPMB argues that the anchor chose the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one ever asked me, but it certainly picked from the studio recordings made in silence, which, of course, they were quite different than the noise of the engine.
I've lived in for quite a few decades, so the names of all those zastávkek know by heart, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere, who are in non-and for which such reports are intended in particular, may be confused and may in the final, where they arrived by mistake, then argue that the stop, which had come forward, was not reported.
Maybe they should have the choice of a broadcaster - but better anchor again - to do it again, and this time, tinged with a normal traffic noise and the roar of the engine, in which the piping of the speaker in the bus almost loses.
So we don't have to listen to any more names stations Water,,, Šmírova, or then the submersible in the creaking, into which I stepped in.
I suppose an ear does not worsen suddenly so much during the course of a single day, when the announcer calls changed.
Before the day the reports I understood quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
Of the traťováka.
Not many people know what kind of government by the biggest and brightest were so-called comprehensive background checks.
I took the liberty of trip down memory lane.
The bus was late.
By then, the controller's office at the moment when the radio said that's just seven hours.
"You're lucky you didn't get hit by a fellow comrade chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that's not in the mood," the dispatcher said, while I was writing in a log.
Thanks, I'll watch it.
Write to me, that I'm going after districts to revise the little mechanisation.
It won't work, today's clearance.
They are scared of it, to the horror.
What's really going on?
"You'll see," the dispatcher said.
Next time you will be, too.
I ran out into the hall.
The door opened and appeared náčelnikárny chief.
Uptight, with a straight face, in a custom-tailored uniform.
"Good morning, Master Chief," I said to respectfully and quickly opened a two-button jacket uniforms.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran up to the second floor, without realizing the cold, an ominous tone of old replied.
"You're dealing with," he greeted me engineer Eva, an elderly woman, which I am very thankful.
He was also the chief of even before her comrades toppled.
There are checks and you get close.
How many times have I asked what are the most comprehensive background checks, but no one wants to talk about it.
They tend to be once every three years, they have to them all, and it's very uncomfortable.
At least for some.
He said I see.
I pulled out of the drawer file periodic reports and then the phone.
"This Holcman, come to me," said the superintendent's voice.
What annoys?
Now we met and nothing... "I muttered, but there was no answer, each alone with my thoughts.
"Good morning, sir, I came to your order," omeldoval myself, when I entered náčelnikárny.
The chief was sitting behind his desk and holding a clipboard.
"Comrade mechanizátore," he said after a moment, without looking up and still studying this piece of paper, "I don't like your behavior."
He tossed the paper on the table, leaning back in his chair and stared at me like a normal, unpleasant, evil, piercing.
I hesitated.
What's going on?
Yesterday, Deputy said that in the last few months in office, I worked very well and he is very happy with me.
The chief did very well when I pulled out of the squad on the break.
And now this?
Remember that you're techniques en route and, in the distance, you have to act.
Such a greeting, what you used this morning, it is simply unacceptable.
I said that the use of such a greeting from childhood that I was brought up and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
The chief, it was like a red rag to a turkey.
"You're a socialist rail and the only acceptable greeting is a tribute to the work," he snapped angrily chief.
And besides, still wrong turning to superiors.
Once you say "sir" and once again, "comrade."
But I'm not Mr. chief for you, but the chief comrade.
The deputies are comrades deputy, Chief Superintendent traťmistři traťmistři are comrades!
That you fondly remember!
Excuse me, sir, sir, but... but I say hello to ordinary civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's an honor to work, or Comrade... you know... I'm not in the side.
"This is not your forte, you're not in the side," he said coldly chief, who had calmed down a little bit.
You still will be on the ground.
Anyway, you must remember that the chair at the top, you don't have a retirement.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something is not his priority, it didn't look good with that.
He glared at me cold, piercing eyes and I was searching for the words to answer.
He also annoyed me that his patronizing familiarity.
It was only a few years older and playing God, actually soudruhaboha.
A jovial, arrogant, authoritarian, arrogant, as he's currently use.
He all.
Granted, it's the chief.
In fact, not all, chairman of the party organisation of all, like him, but also nestraníkům.
But the chief on many, particularly those who are able to exercise their superiority.
Right now I wiped a complete bullshit.
I thought about my ass and it cost me very hard not to shoot him in the face.
But it would have come back into the road to pick, let alone to keep doing of railway official.
From what I feed my two kids?
And to a house!
It made me want to cry, but I controlled myself.
The joy he won't do it.
"That's all for now, you can go," dismissing him chief and began exploring the paper, which had previously been in hand.
At 11: 30, called me.
All of the office were already there, and on the question of what and how they responded, isn't it, that it's going to be good.
Only Heathcliff pointedly said, as was his wont, that they can't get rid of all of us, because they had to do the job alone with his chief comrade, and that it will not.
The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what for me in the morning, old wiped away.
In náčelnikárně was a reunion.
Comrade chief behind his desk at a long conference table and other comrades who should decide about my being or clerical.
,, chairman of the ROH, reporter H.R. examiner for specific purposes, something in the way of kontráše in the army, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organisation.
I knew him from the road.
A construction worker, throwing gravel podbíjel sleepers or a pitchfork.
But also a former prison guard.
There was a rumor that there wasn't any fun with him, said a big beast.
Malicious tongues argued that the school came in seventh grade, was not brought anything, nothing he couldn't.
And when the prison was canceled, ended up on the road with pickaxes.
But comrade, right, comrade was forged.
chief motioned for me to sit down.
bejeebers out, in the neck nespolknutelná cone.
, read the opinion of a civic committee of the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two children and so on and so forth.
So far, so good, I thought, and I breathe a little better.
The report from the street party organisation.
He followed the advice of a civic committee, perhaps it is both written by the same person.
But then it came.
Parents longtime members of the party have refused to appear before the committee, and subsequently by them out, reportedly for medical reasons.
The chief looked sharply at me.
, noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief signaled that has to continue.
Beyond that, it was worse.
I was a member of the urban Committee and there I was obtained for the candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents who stepped down from the side, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and wedding, in addition to the national committee was also in the church.
Confidence Party I failed in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from the ranks of its candidates.
But it wasn't enough.
Both children have left, and even his mother when she died, I said a church funeral, even though he was a former member of the party.
By letting all the negative attitude to the leadership of the party.
When someone read, simply tapping the pencil on the table was broken by an awkward silence.
Everyone was staring at me and I wished I was somewhere far away.
I kept repeating to himself "The Communists - inhuman, the Communists - supermen." What have I got myself into?
Why do I like to stay at blacksmiths?
Fixing a switch I could even without some crappy clearances.
But now?
Career of railway official took for their before it started.
Going back to the squad?
That may not be possible, chief of me definitely out for an hour.
"Comrade, the way you look at issue here, comrade?" interrupted tense silence chief issue on a cadre.
Well, according to the report from the previous job.
You have him here?
Kádrovákovi apparently not twice.
On the temples beads of sweat, blinking nervously, as if he himself was reviewed.
He nodded and handed the chief a piece of paper.
"Well," said the chief with a hint of joviality, which is often used to be a harbinger of a storm.
At first glance, nothing but praise, trained with distinction, studying, working in the piece rates as a locksmith, standard performs at a hundred and twenty percent on average.
But it is missing.
Where did you get that reference, Comrade? "he asked again on a cadre who felt that somehow it is starting to turn against him and that would be very soon, perhaps even have to be kádrovákem.
This comrade gave it to me, at the onset.
That was enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct in the squad," bleated a personnel manager.
And there are reports do not require, that it was somehow more, so I gave it to him in a folder.
"So in addition to the technical functions you this piece of paper he could," the chief said.
, blinking nervously, and not have to answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss it later," said the chief issue and kádrovákovi looked relieved.
In the meantime, it.
"So, what with you, Comrade?" he asked the chief once again to me.
Suddenly vyká me, so that's the end of the!
In the eyes of my mind went blank, scalding hot me.
This was followed by a surge of remorse and charges, and I knew it was the most disgusting creature in the world that doesn't deserve any mercy.
That planting an incomplete report I misled the cadre of Comrade examiner, and I couldn't understand why the report was incomplete, when I got it from a cadre at the factory.
I also antisocialistický element that at a time of real socialism promotes the hustle and religious obscurantism, indeed, even participate in them.
That, of course, was that a lot of the things I've done, or maybe even commit and quiet I prayed for it to end.
I was all one.
It didn't matter that a leap off the site.
I didn't care that I take even the pickaxe.
This is a job for an honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people that I was in the eyes of Comrade chief.
"That's it, sir," said the chairman of the parties and the chief's levity interrupted emphatically.
This comrade made a mistake, a terrible mistake.
What a mistake, directly stupid!
But he's already got his sentence.
Don't forget that, sir!
What could be worse for a young person than he had at the time we close the door to the side.
So he opened again, he will have to demonstrate that he has changed, that is worthy of our trust again.
Ignorant guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
It's so well-read or repeated phrases from partisan training sessions and meetings?
It is also why this young comrade must get from us a chance!
A chance to prove that has changed.
And who has to give it to him, if not just you, sir?
It is your duty this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, support in its efforts to remedy.
It's your duty to the party, which will never be rid of it.
In fact, it is the party also duty of all of us.
This comrade must see that his party has not forgotten.
That is not only as a loving mother, but he also loves.
When the President ended, no one said a word.
Such a turnaround situation, no one expected.
At least I.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman," he said icily chief in an attempt to regain the initiative.
If you let me finish, you heard that right, I was going to such a conclusion.
They nod their heads, but it was for them to see that he doesn't believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the function of an independent examiner care about basic resources," I went back to the office and then I started to cry.
Even that in addition to engineer Eva everyone was at lunch.
The silently listening to my incoherent trial of fresh experiences and I had calmed down.
When I finished, she asked whether he'll have a cup of coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, standing water on the stove and preparing cups.
In the meantime, about kádrováckých practices.
As one report, often full of praise, put into a man's hand, and the second, in which is kind of scum, send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was, but on the road with pickaxes, and so comrades from the factory did not know where to send them.
And our a personnel manager?
That's just an old, where he ate or drank, and so it turned out the way it did.
"He's from the old gets it," she said mischievously.
Today, he certainly won't like it.
Still, watch out for him, is a vindictive.
And the party chairman?
In fact, far worse chief, a philanthropist.
Zero from picks having a great power.
The water will boil for coffee and then the office was filled with the smell of freshly bathed in coffee.
I dropped into the cup sugar cube and silently shuffling hot brew.
I was out of the woods yet.
You can't fire me and other checks are up for three years.
Anyway, comrade chief whip on me that day.
Many in the anthology LITERÁTI ON TRACK II in publishing EPIKA
A symbol of community came to life.
The pinwheel over Chlumem, after years of once again revolve.
It is seen by far, because it is located on a 15-foot flagpole.
People from a wide area they call him "on the" fan.
For a community with a population of 150 became even one of the elements of the character, who got to celebrate the reunion of her own community in 2010.
"We're pulling back then about character and the fan at character, of course, we wanted to have, everyone knows it," the mayor said.
Chlumské wind pump is a local technical.
It is also a reminder of the moment: recalls a time when local people fought about the quality of drinking water.
The in Chlum in past centuries, is rare.
When in 1910 decided chlumští representatives for a solution that will suit until the mid-1980s.
In the community for on the Cave Číchov left seven meters deep well.
Three years later the well complemented by a metal structure with a pump, which benefited from the water in the reservoir at the highest point of the municipality, near the church.
"The construction company performed Antonin from Limits on a cargo of 2 400 pennies," states a commemorative inscription on the ground-level fence construction flagpole.
The pump after a few corrections and downs a windmill broke down in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, then began to write a new chapter in the struggle for water: the day in Chlum began to serve a new water main.
Wind pump has remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and its rarity.
Dominantu finished at this year's reunion.
When in 2008, Chlumští decided that wind round again be repaired and put back into operation.
They had to build a replica of the original wheels - a scaled-down about half a metre in diameter.
The bike was fitted to the mast, even the same year, however, had to be put down.
The manufacturer of the reply is not an appropriate material and round couldn't resist the wind.
After a few years of resting chlumská dismantled under the roof.
From June this year, however, the bike on a high pole again revolve.
On the occasion of the reunion of her own community let replica of the wheels to adjust osadila and returned him to the top of the iron tower.
But round draws water from the well only to spill the billabong.
And over the summer, we have taken off him, because there was not enough water in the well.
It was shot at least.
"In the fall, then the shaft from the windmill pumps in the basket off again," explained the mayor.
Chlum isn't the only municipalities in the Czech Republic, where the wind got round to the character, however, is the only member of this kind in the Highlands.
A similar element in the characters have to honor the local technical monuments such as Chvalkovicích and Green Mountain on, in Kuzelov on, Partutovicích on or in on.
No offense, but we don't know, "admitted supporter Tripoli Goian.
"The struggle against I remember very well, and my goal, like all of my career," said 34letý Goian at the press conference.
He coached us Georghe Hagi, it was sad that we lost.
I hope I score, even now.
Only with the difference that this time we will not fail, "said Goian.
It is this man who played 60 games for the Romanian representation, is a key backer of the Greek team.
As the shortstop will face runs the offensive.
There will be a few thousand people, no hell, says about Greek combat Spartan Hybs.
And partly knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
Well-known Fataie, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
At the time, I saw all of their games.
I know that this is a very good striker, therefore also went to Sparta, Goian said.
Another player the club by name, and then came the direct question whether he knows, and David, the best in the history of the league and the captain.
Goian smiled and with a slightly reproachful glance was headed to the journalist.
Destitute expression on his face marked: "Why are you asking me?"
After a moment of silence began.
We saw some videos, and I noticed that the Spartans plays a lot of teams.
He's a really good players.
And Bonds?
No hard feelings, but I don't know anyone else except Fataie.
The Spartans about Goianovi knows very well.
"My experience of the bigger clubs, we can say that holds Asterasu defense, it is an organizer of the games," observed the assistant Stanislav Goblin.
Goian already has the best years in a row, but boasts a very interesting football curriculum vitae.
At the time it was interested in, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City units, but headed into the Italian Steauy from Palermo, played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're an aggressive and unusual style, says coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays of Europe, vying for victory in the league.
For me, it's the favorite in this game, but we are playing at home and we want to get a good result for the group.
Just as the Spartans, we will try to win, "said Goian.
I'm at peace with his goalie Košickým Thomas, who was a rival from a lot of pleasure.
I too.
But for the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.

The new headquarters should have in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of trading in shares of the company on the stock market.
Our primary objective is to have the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps that we have taken in the context of the project for the time being, they're mostly legal and administrative and do not have a material impact on what is going on in society, says Daniel, financial the director of the group.

Moving the headquarters of the holding company and the related transfers of shares will be made in the form of a private transaction, on the grounds that it will participate only existing shareholders.

The test of objectivity in reporting on migrantské television in a crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time, the main news programme broadcast television.
And how stand up?
When they're at journalism faculty to teach about how the media can manipulate reality, they can put today's broadcast television events.
Migrantské crisis was devoted to about 80% of the broadcast news.
Except for the first minute, when the informed about the unrest at the Serbian-Hungarian border and attacks on police officers euphemistically called migrants they ran out of patience - throwing stones and metal rods), I was driving the current promigrantská propaganda - themselves names of individual coverage.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a big space for non-profit organisations that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
The refugees, not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Wandering refugees - has consistently used expressions coached migrant and refugee and migrant.
What is striking is mainly that in illustrative footage used consistently only images of young children and women.
However, alone in the same broadcast reported that of the migrants were apprehended in the Czech Republic is 80% of men.
Summary: For the most part propaganda, which is unprecedented since the communist.
I have to say that, as a former journalist for colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I had once been resurrected in an apartment, I soon cease to be the sole inhabitant.
On the Formica silverfish moved in with me.
of domestic, insects with metamorphosis, i.e., the transition from neprodělávající caterpillars to bug and cub looks like an adult, only a tiny and gradually grows.
I was disgusting and I took the opportunity to kill them.
First, by hand, and later and chemically.
The Socialist store at their disposal to provide a kind of blue crystals.
I think it was called Zyklon B's
Or something else?
You liquidated, however, it successfully.
Later, I handled it with the pharaohs similarly.
juvenalizátorem Krabičkou with some who have been added to the ants nest, and then he wouldn't let the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, it became the subject of my admiration and insects, and increasingly I'm leaning towards the view that they have the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from my life experience that interference in the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace the second.
The truth at fleas, bedbugs, I would probably not hesitate to exacerbate the karma by killing them.
In a new residence with his partner, we agreed that if we do not roaches climb by the neck to calm eating crisps renegade skin, some of those invisible eyelashes, and things like that.
Their quiet existence over time, the spider.
It was a common type of pokoutníka, who has long dwelt on the ceiling.
We consider that the lives of the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which will only increase comfort.
Because he had lived with us for a couple of years, we found that feeds mainly rybenkami and that their number is likely to maintain the status quo on transportation.
In a confidential way regular contact with each of the need, we found that it's a female.
We were actually witnessing a romantic courtship with partner about a third less, how carefully strumming spiderwebs, not to be eaten before it reaches the coveted copulation.
It took about three days ago, when silent and neither did not respond to our control.
Under the toilet bowl, where America games taking place, we're next to the female later found remnants of dried male.
Then the spider long weeks not budge.
If we thought it was over, we were amazed at the amount of small spiders, hanging scattered in its surroundings.
soon disappeared.
Partly they were eaten by her mother, the work of scattered elsewhere.
Even after a week of female disappeared.
If left somewhere else or passed away, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a slightly smaller, probably the daughter of another praobyvatelky toilet.
For a while, from the ceiling warily watched our behavior and shifting beneath the toilet bowl evaluate our non-aggression pact as a friendship.
The numerical state somewhat multiplied rybenek declined again and spider, calmly looked normal activities to ensure the food.
The whole year to our ecosystem.
Our daughter between that has reached the age where the use of pot was a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated, but eternal spilling its contents have we really got sick.
We encouraged her still more forcefully to use the toilet.
The daughter, however, to maintain his habit found an excuse in the spider, which saw when wiping very well.
Our talk about they see a spider, happiness in the House have ever taken.
Crying and screaming to enforce its pot.
It wasn't.
There was a moment, when he had a spider, in the interest of the shift daughters, orders.
It was left up to me.
He was caught in a jar and banished from the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I was saying goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt awful after so long co-existence, as if I were a relative.
We assumed that the roaches start to appear more frequently and they'll multiply exponentially.
Amazingly enough, a week or two, there's no-show.
I started to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if there is the spider along the lines of the ants somehow acknowledged that the toilet is not as favourable environment for their existence, as we thought.
Then there were the first mid-size pieces, and never came back.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance and I've come to know that their link to the spider had to be the cause of that, when he sees that he is holed up in a different place, and that they're in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe had a telepathic connection with its predator and its rapid disappearance triggered an alert in response.
The more that talk about their vision no illusions.
Some light shyness showed, but that it would respond to the hand-waving or sudden movements, do not.
The daughter already regularly go to the bathroom.
I think I forgot the potty-trained.
It remains only to attract back a spider.
Have I send their wishes into the ether and I hope that never gave up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we would have to use the Cyclone B.
The Ten sayings, Albert Einstein, which enrich the world.
Statements by genius scientist from the last century humanity probably never will continue to fascinate.
He managed to dive so deeply into everything that has always been a figment of startling findings.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most prominent scientists of all time.
The people's awareness came in above all its special and general theory of relativity, which has the best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
It also ignored his clarification kvantování fotoefektu or the idea of an electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the system and knowledge to the popular theory of relativity is for many so convoluted that rather vote for a closer look easy comparisons.
But it's not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, were also found on this brilliantly simplified form of explanation: An hour in the vicinity of your beloved seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of the whole of his famous quotes to choose these ten, which literally seduced me.
Smart people are trying to solve problems, a genius is trying to do.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
For the first, I am not so sure.
No amount of experiments can never prove that I was right.
The only, however, whenever it may prove that I was wrong.
It's a sad time, when it is easier to break the atom than destroy preconceptions.
If the mess on the table reflects the mess in mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what's going to fight in World War II, but it will be in the fourth sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to revive him.
Knowing little is dangerous and know too much.
If I had available an hour to tackle the problem, if my life depended on it, I'd spent 40 minutes of his studio, 15 minutes of his analysis and 5 minutes of his solution.
The world of the hardest thing to understanding the income tax.
In conclusion, I can't forgive omitted Einstein's definition of the formula for success: Taking And for success, is true formula: A = X + Y + Z, where labour is X, Y and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
The new and modern.
Hospitals in the county are waiting for change for $1.5 billion.
"It's a success, considering that all this year, all four stands in the black," he said.
The total profit the facilities at this moment is about $32 million.
The on that are mainly higher reimbursement from insurance companies, which are as positive, even for this year.
Even this fact shows that after years of poor hospital can finally afford a bigger investment.
In the, the, and the result was coming to the edifice, which together will cost almost $1.5 billion.
The long period when we buy mainly machines, has ended.
Now we have to start to build new buildings, because without them with high-tech health care do not, the case for the Deputy plans for health care.
The changes enjoys in all hospitals.
Clients come to hospitals for next year.
In the now collect supplier of new internal pavilion for almost 300 million pennies.
In have scheduled an addition of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to open the central pavilion this year to build a regular for roughly $200 million.
And the hospital waiting for the long-delayed construction of a new central income and internal medicine, in which will need to be three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is a vital and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the entire region, patients and doctors, it is an extremely important step," she said, for example, to build the hospital director Vera Prousková arrived.
Pětipatrová building there has to be finished in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal medicine and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and the intensive care unit.
The greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which will significantly more patients, will affect all regions.
The new building will replace the ones in which, for example, is that many people in one room, on the floor, they have to be only one bathroom, bed are nepolohovatelné, windows and health workers do not have adequate conditions for the job.
"For example, our interna was built 35 years ago and now is on the verge of their lives," the director of the hospital Els.
Within a few years, because it will replace the seven-storey modern building links with the income.
Doctors and patients will have in one place all the emergency department, also in new areas.
The same model already has a half-finished.
The central income now stands and within three years for him to add interna.
"If we are going to pay off the loan, and partly from its own resources," explained director Peter.
It is this hospital's own funding is the only one in the country can afford.
Profit still has the highest and couldn't get into the loss of two years ago, when the hospital to be dealt with almost dvousetmilionovou loss.
"We have a good contract with Medicare, an excellent performance, increasing revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," listed Vajdák Morton, who is in charge of the economy.
Improvements to receive and patients of the hospital.
During the 10-15 years will go into repairs, new devices and reconstruction of up to half a billion.
Already this year will be complete repair stations, then begin rehabilitation of dialysis, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one me how I had adopted the refugees in the country to maintain, if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
The Secretary of Homeland Security (), after negotiations with the European colleagues complained that other states are pushing for the adoption of quotas for the reallocation of refugees, but any discussion refuse.
He also observes that no one has yet explained to him how he should be allocated to refugees in the Czech Republic to maintain, if they don't want to live with us as well.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted to quotas have been omitted from the final text," he said journalists.
You can specifically describe a position with which you came at the interior and foreign ministers of the European Union?
We disagree with the mandatory quotas as with a system that simply won't work.
The migrants can't talk like a sack of salt or flour.
They are living creatures, which have some vision, going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues, the way we're capable of migrants on the territory of the Member States to maintain, if redistribuovali.
We can't imagine it.
The answer, we didn't get it, and that's why we wanted to quotas have been omitted from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hot spots, namely registrars, border protection, camps outside of Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we don't have any problem with that.
We are talking for a year and we're saying that this is the way to go.
But to say that the quota solve everything?
Recently, we have faced forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how can we keep all those people on the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who pass through us, wants to Germany.
To us, almost no one, we just don't know how it is here to stay.
To us, they have an ambition to go other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, gaining azyly for us, but the interest of the people of the waves of migration, from Syria and other countries, is close to zero.
You mentioned that you really don't want to see us refugees, but fifteen hundred people we have already committed to adopt.
Wouldn't it be possible for them to accept this way more?
We are committed to accept 1,500 people, but with the condition.
We say: functional hot spots, border protection, a military operation.
Even in the 1,500-point is that comes 1100 people settle asylum procedure.
They come into our the detention facility, and we will treat them as well as to those that we received.
It's a big question, and we'll talk about it with Europe, if we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, where appropriate, in Hungary.
Because Europe to act as if they have the registration, they cannot be detained.
That means there will be on our territory with registration, and if the agreement, which is not yet, it may be that even those 1100 hold on the territory of the Czech Republic and they came back to Germany after they leave.
If we can hold them for the duration of the asylum procedure, deal with them asylum procedure.
If the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, so almost 98 percent, according to the European statistics are gaining international protection.
Then they get the documents, which will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people again, ends up in targeted countries.
Then there's four hundred people who will be přesídlovat.
This is the second project, which has so far, and that's where we've come only in that debate with churches about the possibility that they could help to find employment, housing and so forth.
But it is running on a very long haul.
You said that at a meeting of ministers with us the other states were not willing to discuss.
But it is not so that the Czech Republic just refuses to quotas, but offers no joint step that would block the discussion?
And what exactly is supposed to be under joint you step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany utters the incentive that all migrants from Syria could get to them, so the news is spreading in the order of hours after all the camps around Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another wave of migration, which seeks to Germany, because we just don't want to.
We think that the path is the protection of the external borders - just the waves of migration dissuade, to help those in need, and separate economic migrants.
Obviously to let them know that they don't have a chance.
Only in the last year to Germany came fifty thousand Kosovars.
From the safety of Kosovo, where we're all the saturation of the state, including the police, courts and prosecutor's offices.
If we were able to separate them and not accepting or receiving only according to the needs of the economy, so would the 50 percent of what their social systems in vain issued today, could go to refugees.
On the first day, when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day it was 12 years old.
Where once it has come to have tightened border controls?
We were afraid of in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers that we manage.
We still have a few hundred seats left in the detention facilities.
Of course, all of the people that we arrest, we will be back within seven days, Austria.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who those people are, with Hungary's complicated and Greeks - it is completely pointless story.
Where is the tipping point?
It would be worth $1,000 a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days we will run out of capacity, so much so that takes contingency plans.
Then I agreed with Mr. Prime Minister, that would immediately called an emergency government.
He was very concerned about the whole thing, we have several times a day in telephone contact.
If the situation, the government can sit at the de facto immediately and one resolution would have decided to reinforce the police about an army of, say, the customs administration, or by the prison service.
The extreme option is the state of emergency, which now in some places declared Hungary?
I think that it can't happen to us this far.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe's Schengen border only, and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for it to get this done in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarm information.
All of the information that we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggesting instead that the Hungarians try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then have meant the direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off at the last minute, a large part of the debt.
He's trying to prevent the bankruptcy.

Your money is not even footballers.
has appeared on Tuesday for the first time because of an insolvency proceedings before the court.
Nearly three months after her because of the roughly 20 million pennies lodged an application company Online Services of Pacific Samoa.
Legal representatives of Susan Mládková tried to Judge Michael Wenzlovou within a few hours to convince that has over to declare bankruptcy.
And to say, of the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week's new owner has become a major Chinese industrial and investment group of and also the "billionaire.
Obviously, from the new owners of the club's money, and at the last minute.
It shows the observations before Tuesday's hearing - a club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, sent owed tens of millions of pennies.
"Everything was between 9 / 11 and 15 September paid," the attorney said.
Who paid?
The current and former players and trading partners.
In particular, for example, a Slovak the Milano Ivan or the záložníkovi Maria up.
Slavia also paid the fee agent Alexander Losenickemu.
And on Friday the club paid the fees owed to urban parts of the 10.
Part of the insolvency proceedings so remain de facto only claims that the disputes.
Either according to club commitments given not at all, or lead to litigation.
However, we are prepared in the event of losing these disputes the amount to pay.
"The necessary resources we have in the bank account, which can produce a bank account," she told the Judge Advocate General.
"Everything was overdue, is paid," said Mládková and added that not only are unpaid or disputed liabilities.
What is certain is that in the next few days, the judge decides and management will continue.
She gave three weeks ago that sent a detailed evidence that actually pay these debts.
Subsequently, there will be a review of all the evidence.
The decision can be expected to begin in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of negotiations on November 3.
The decision, however, doesn't even at this meeting, but only after it in writing.

Profits FedEx mixed, reducing the fiscal outlook for 2016
The company FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in the full-year profit forecasts because of low demand for freight and higher costs for land-based division.
The company also said that it plans to hire over the holidays about 55,000 seasonal workers.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Shares in the company have fallen by around 2.5 percent in trading předtržním 45 minutes before the opening.
The company FedEx states that it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which means a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecasts.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
Reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January 4, and higher premiums for ground transport heavy or large packages, which start in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost cutting, higher revenues and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company was "a solid performance despite a weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing sector and global trade."
The plans holiday hiring was announced a day after rivalská UPS said that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, which is about as much as was hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is about 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, which is less than the $2.44. per share, which was predicted 12 analysts questioned Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose about 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
The company FedEx was hit by a decline in recent years, senior international shipping, which caused that revenues in its Express unit stagnated.
But the boom in online shopping has strengthened the results of FedEx ground troops.
In the last quarter of the inland revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for bigger packages and their own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income because of higher base rates, while profit fell in the trade because of higher prices for the workforce.
In předtržním trading about an hour before the opening FedEx "shares have fallen about $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
At its most expected when sitting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week, established in the 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table and will decide whether, after almost 10 years, the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the central bank's great design, a three-story mural will be meeting room of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has a double charge of Congress: to maximize the American jobs and keep the price stable.
But since the Great Recession Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And the third term could be the X-factor in too close to a predictable decision, which is to be announced on Thursday, about whether the US economy is ready to launch in shutting down of unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rate at the site since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a solid growth in the economy, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the Fed has already cautious about adding to volatility by increasing its benchmark federal funds rate - and it's also about nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the job market and inflation will be in the front row, the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that just looking for an excuse for not hiking rates, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market them already provides sufficient justification to wait any longer," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is a cause of nervousness in financial markets.
About half of the economists surveyed by Blomberg recently predicted an increase in rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to hold off on the issue, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
That would have pointed to a decline in the stock market in the event that the Fed will raise rates only if politicians would soften the slump in the promise that a further increase in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped about 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that the Fed policymakers hold rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he says.
If it did, the Fed policymakers, "they would have to go to the limit in his statement and hold hands financial markets to the forfeiture panic."
Other experts said that an increase in rates would have calmed financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed will proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Fed is on track to increase rates by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that through the spring and early summer is expected to raise rates this year, despite complaints from liberals, there is a need for more economic progress.
Even if the job creation has slowed in August, the labour market this year recorded solid growth.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which was the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level at which the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And even if inflation continues to take place under the central bank's target of 2% annual rate, the Fed policymakers argue that the main reason was a temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher rates and needs is, with respect to the tightness in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to struggle at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average has fallen to about 16 per cent below its record high value in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy dragged down global growth.
The market rebounded slightly this month, and the Dow is only now almost 10% from the peak in May.
Fed policy makers market turmoil adds a complex calculus, when to start raising interest rates.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening up at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a leading researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
It now predicts that the wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and have almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is one of the main concerns of the Fed, so technically should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become a monetary authority from around the world.
The influence of central banks in recent years was enormous.
The mere suggestion of then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed may "taper" its monetary expansion in the market, triggered convulsions throughout the world.
In a world where the markets and the economy are still more closely connected, it can be expected that Fed officials are watching the developments elsewhere, but also consults with other central bankers and professionals, so they better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet, Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated with movements in financial markets, which seem incoherent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for an increase in rates, cited in 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point during three meetings "Despite limited identifiable impacts on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.
The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during the Great Depression, as was the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee setting rates at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil is even close to that level, he said.
"You don't want to be in a situation of fear of growth rates, because it upset markets," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate and makes no mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think he should get on top.

The case concerns the supposedly project Olive trees.
Police wanted in this case to prosecute the congresswoman Susan Kailovou (), the Chamber of Deputies, but it did not.
According to the legal characterisation case threatens the two to 10 years in prison.

Both charges led to ensure society for the award of the contract to host the event Olive trees in over the long-term and coordinated at least acted contrary to the requirement for a procedure with proper care, say prosecutors.

The Hungarian police reportedly embarked on a dog.
Then make journalists to delete the footage.
Hungarian police said on the border with Serbia briefly jailed photographer agencies and forced him to erase footage, in which a police dog allegedly knocked to the ground by a fugitive.
The Hungarian government but denies this charge.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night, when the AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants who through a cornfield near the Hungarian town Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
Against the refugees police and one of them left on a Syrian attack dog with a basket on the nose.
The man who was screaming, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," sling, says Muzi.
The one that Men's filming everything, he noticed one of the officers and wouldn't let him leave.
The reporter then allowed a phone call, nor his superiors and colleagues at the site.
The officers were taken to a dark place at Muziho registration center for refugees and asked him to show them what has staged.
Then ordered him to record erased.
Men like this came about the outcome of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt to be in danger, because there were dogs.
The agency sent a letter of protest to the spokesman of the Hungarian government Zoltánu Kovács.
The behaviour of the police officers in it has identified as unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and fear that the government will destroy the material obtained legally.
Kovacs, citing a police report questioned Muziho versions of events.
He said that police just wanted to show them a journalist, whether they are on some of the footage, to which they are entitled.
When they found out that there are not, forced him to erase anything.
"The dogs may bark - are trained to odstrašovali and chased a little scared, but weren't fighting with certainty," says Kovács.
Unpredictable Champions League.
A win for City us, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, coach of domestic City.
We had more chances and we played better than either Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team has created a lot of chances, but we had the ball on for longer.
"The defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just scored two great goals," game Pellegrini, whose team in the match after long 636 minutes.
A finalist last season Juventus on it was a mutual encounters exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian League has as the defending champion only point and the score 2: 4 is up to 16th place in the table.
Even so, the turnover at the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us psychologically, kicking off in us," believe coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to before the new deal with the loss of three backers - Pirlo, a and Vidal.
In Manchester is barred I, and Morata.
"It's so, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him on winning a wave," hopes Morata.
Because if we're on it, among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
This result of my players deserve.
"Before our goal, we could, on the contrary, collect at 0: 2, but Gianluigi us," said coach Allegri.
"We burned several good chances," Touré, Yayu, City's midfield.
We have to take out of the Champions League experience and the next time, try to a better outcome.
Goodbye, Angela, goodbye to the old Germany II.
Before we go any further on the issue of immigrants, we should recognize that the media frenzy around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media, and also from above.
And so let's stop for a minute.
Today newspaper and media are full of babies, which are at the hands of their parents after the dusty roads exodus.
And it raises in person - that is, in a European man - automatically guilt and remorse.
Well, they don't come just a desperate babies, you'll notice on the landing craft to the Greek islands that babies on them so much to see.
Well, and somehow we recently disappeared from television pictures of ships headed to Lampedusa, refugees from the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenade they'll lay out thousands of young men.
For the most part of young black men.
And also disappeared images from Calais, where these brown and black men are waiting to find out if they can get through a tunnel under the English Channel.
I was unmoved.
Neither the pictures of primitive Christian church Eritreans somehow didn't particularly impressed with the peoples of Europe.
Too much of it was falseness.
So when it comes to the quota for refugees, but somehow, that it's not just about the unfortunate children from Syria, but also about the styling - for older: the fashionably - young men.
With the musculature look as if they had just come out of a gym.
There is only one personal experience.
This summer, on the Turkish-Cypriot Muslim - we lay on a private beach hotel.
Regardless, it was a private, came to the beach at once a large group of cars.
But no ham.
All of them got out young black men.
About 30 men and five women.
The Age of between 15 and 30 years ago.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes in hand, how else, smartphones.
That is a private beach, is not interested and staff - Turks and Muslims! - are clearly worried.
They took all the couches.
Who was on him and he was in the sea, he was out of luck.
They were dressed as the American rapperského film.
On their heads with a fingernail, white and colored Adidas shoes on your feet.
Then laid siege to the local beach bar and began to feast.
The tables around, stuffed to the brown and white guests seated next to the bar - read the Muslims and the Europeans, without being asked.
Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming blacks drank beer straight from třetinek - as in soap operas of the US?! - on the beach tossing around the empty bottles.
He loudly shouting at each other.
In English, of course, it wasn't.
Then they began to drink wine, also straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, particularly the young ladies - in the water screaming and shouting, mothers with children and pensioners ran away and for half an hour longer on the beach or in the swimming pool or one nečerný guest.
They all.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were feared even just to talk about them.
The waiter crooning me tonight said: "Have you seen this baby, who were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, it certainly didn't work," said the waiter.
I thought: "I know, all had a massive gold chains around their necks.
And one was saddled with six-inch or so massive cross of gold.
And women were as jewelry store.
"These are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw how drinking," said the waiter.
Drugs nepašují, or not.
Those smuggling something else entirely.
So for me, it was clear what they were smuggling.
But in June, 2105 it still wasn't so important for me.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
But the secret services and the politicians should know first.
It doesn't seem to me that they didn't know.
In Europe, at the time, about 1.5 million immigrants.
And they go and go and go.
Today, it emerged that the European Union's main problem is that totalitarian-politico-correct politicians, intellectuals and attached to them lobbying and economically important groups have in Europe's biggest strength.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly acknowledged the main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but it's not just them, as well as the EU's leaders and television, including ours.
For example, a recent television images of an enthusiastic welcome refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow television images of August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sluníčkářů at the station, but more importantly - staroněmečtí - Muslims greeted his fellow countrymen.
The long weeks prattling on the news on television, as they are, according to some research, almost all the Germans for the arrival of emigrants.
However, who was only a few days in Germany, he knows that it is a lie.
Which confirm further information.
For example, the famous opinion poll organized ARD public television companies - "Association of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the claim ARD took a week ago, more than 50% of Germans to accept more refugees.
It also meldovaly our television.
But concealed what the next day burst in Germany: that in the vote to the article, it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans want more immigrants - 67 000 people participated in the survey.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "Our efforts to prove the substantiality attributes the company a total failure."
In addition, then said: "Germany surrenders struggle for a multicultural society."
"All the efforts of such coexistence totally failed."
In a country where they live four million Muslims, according to her failed strategy that people from different cultural environment allowed to live next door to each other, and to integrate. Today live here with us and we have some time that will one day disappear.
But that's not the reality.
A multicultural approach, when we say that just happen to live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.
I failed.
But neither Merkel probably doesn't have the strength to go against the mighty Germany and Europe and especially against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, the MP for the SPD, the only one who held supposedly doesn't even have a high school diploma - yes, that's the one in the European Parliament, Berlusconi said he could play a guard in a concentration camp by the minute - as demonstrated again.
It seems, especially in the wake of the recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, to some, these statements do not support most European politicians, statesmen of countries that have been the victims of Nazism, are dismayed.
What is it with the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
They have tried for years to, at least outwardly, deal with his terrible past the aggressor and killer million?
They are right, those who say that in Germany is seeded soul to the devil aggression, superiority and violence?
He was right Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as with all your might stop Velkoněmců attempts to dominate the entire centre of Europe?
When he said that Germany will destroy velkoněmecká idea?
I should.
When it was impounded, began preparing for the First World War.
The idea of Velkoněmecka that brought the Germans and Europe into two wars that have cost millions of lives, are likely to be back in a different form.
After attempting Marxists control of the state, for example, with Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany, for example, on the basis of ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main the lore of Nazism, began to develop new German ideology.
They said we the Pollyanna.
Germany's elite has long prevented the emergence of German nationalism, and then left the room all the fighters against the atom, enthusiasts looking for a haven for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our les must live.
To satisfy restless young people all over the world who want to do something different and better, fully are now on the side of fighters against the warming of the planet, stop nuclear power plants, etc.
And forget that in this current also strongly anti-Semitic - so-called propalestinský exists - and considering all the Slavs antislovanský stream for the difficult thing - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the parents Jew, was mainly German nationalist.
And also, as shown by recent statements Schulze and the German ministerial openly rebellious eastern states, the idea of Germany.
Which is to be without hearing argument.
Otherwise, woe betide you!
And when it under the guise that immigrants are very suggestion by a group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is, as always, the capital, especially the German, who is comfortable and who could benefit from the fact that Germany and the European Union over the banks actually controls most of the states of Europe.
Pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduced the Germans into the swamps and multiklturalismu and today they brought home and maybe even bring millions of Muslims.
Which, seduced by the siren voices, hit the wall early reality that Merkel wants to see, and they start to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors by force, once again, is part of its population - but it seems, still less part - ideologically, but reality as always catches up with him in the end.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim dormitories already on fire.
What does the German government, when the German public protests against the newcomers Islamists?
Jimž come to help Muslims have long been living in Germany, but certainly not asimilovaní so to take over the local customs and laws?
What does the German government to take it out on each other, Muslims, incoming Islamists and the Germans, fearing Islamization watching their country?
What does that do to the Germans, and even with Germany, to get people who will be loudly and publicly to protest against a new euro-Superman Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which in Europe caused by promoting sluníčkářské ideology, that is, in principle, elitist and totalitarian ideology, and their greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the riotous behaviour towards the democratic Germans and all third-rate and the riotous eastern neighbours can't turn out well.
Completion of tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the pushy vendors: scare them to death.
You only have to knock on your door knockers and robust demand in a way that weaker nature doesn't just stand.
Animated head you pretty sister and chased and callous, on the way out (or, rather, drives them) will accompany the seller and a living sculpture.
Maybe a pity that he cannot even get a knocker in fact.
Even for us, it would be helpful to ward off a lot of jagoffs and scum.
Wood sorrel Oxydol corniculata trefoil ().
Small weeds, which tolerates dry environment.
And so it is located between the tiles near my home.
On 16 September 2015 I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to an expansive weeds, but visually creates a good impression, in terms of flowering.
Among the tiles are located.

The Brazilian society Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet while breast-feeding
The Brazilian society SPRS came with a shocking way to try to broker a women's knowledge about the importance of a good diet in feeding through images of children suckling breast vymalovaného depiction of junk food.
Human breast milk is composed of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbs, supplying infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements is recommended to pregnant women and new mothers to increase daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only addition to mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterlandem, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affected the genetic creation of their children and protect them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it also confirmed that unhealthy dieting negatively affect a child's immune system.

Jarryd Hayne had several options for where to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams are hot spots for his excellent start training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let sit Hayne for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he did convert Australian rugbiové League at the first kickoff of the pitch in winning 20-3 at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he has confidence in the players and gave him another chance to come back and took him into the game after the injured Reggie Bush.
Tomsula was also continues to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of newcomers chewing before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, said that Hayne also got a boost from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and cared only about the next game.
Even during the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne atoned for his mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't the start, in which Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured during the swearing when he left the field after the error and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 worse start to a career in the NFL, you couldn't even imagine.
"It happens, just focus on the next game and that's all," said Hayne
Hayne likened embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a record in their own Touchdown led to three Queensland.
Overall, it was for the 27-year-old player, a great experience.
Hayne posted a photo with the fans, which holds the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.

The court first gives them the required amount, over 2.8 million pennies, the Court of Appeal, but their claim changed so that they admitted only less than 90 thousand pennies, with reference to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined by the price of the 1991 regulations.
Emigrantů are the Supreme Court and the amount originally awarded them the defendant.
The Treasury Department, which had the money to pay, but turned to the complaints.
In the meantime, there has been a change in the social and economic conditions of that compensation granted under the existing legislation - albeit then constituted an adequate replacement in relation to the withdrawal of the property - now stands at only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the detriment of the interveners as in restitution claimants who have their rights to demand at least since 1995 and who were unable to obtain a refund sooner," Judge-Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk explained why it is built on the side of emigrants.
"ÚS has repeatedly called for a general courts acted in restitution cases so that any inconsistency has been interpreted to the detriment of beneficiaries and to always achieved the purpose of the law, that is to atone for their financial woes caused by acts of the former totalitarian state," added the judge.

Four people were killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd of protesters against the proposal for a new state constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in a neighborhood Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, argues that, with more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some hurled rocks and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal reports that police used tear gas and fired into the air before resorting to a rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, reports.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill, but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused the high number of deaths.
The confrontation was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of ethnic Madhesi groups say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution, and ease their political influence.
Other demonstrations were also recorded in western Nepal ethnic Tharus group, which calls for the creation of their own state.
From 10 August was in violent clashes killed at least 40 people, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties have signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed centuries.
Work on a new constitution have been dating since 2008, but legislators to speed up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators in Kathmandu voted this week on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials indicated that the new charter should be taken until Sunday.
And now we must not panic.
After losing the championship on the ice, you couldn't even domestic duel with hockey players (3-5).
You have no fears of a similarly disastrous entry into as a year ago?
I hope that nothing like this happens again.

For moderately obese diabetics could be useful weight-loss surgery
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether the moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes are living longer after weight-loss surgery than those who are non-surgical treatment.
"The data on mortality persist long time to view," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight-loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
The surgery for weight-loss, surgery for stomach-reduction using different methods.
Reducing hunger and the limitations of the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, the operations proved to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was carried out on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which is a measure of weight relative to height relationship, is considered normal in terms of between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI of 25 or higher indicates overweight people and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, the researchers used from Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study from 2007, which deals with two types of gastric bypass surgery - bariatrické and gastrectomy - in the therapeutic procedures Type 3 diabetes in people who were moderately obese.
The average BMI between those who underwent surgery, according to a study has fallen from 31% to 24.5 towards the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, has remained a BMI of those who have been granted a surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly equal to the value of 29.
Among patients with diabetes was resolved completely operations in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the drugs group was treated for diabetes resolved completely, compared with only 1 percent and partly for only about 2 percent of patients.
It also was the control of blood pressure, trigylceridů and "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is the best way to keep below 7 percent, the researchers reported.
After the surgery, the average value of hemoglobin A1c has fallen from about 9 percent of the roughly 6 percent.
In the treated group, however, the value of the drugs remained at about 8 percent.
But this better glycaemic control "" - which is reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year with the bypass group lost more weight compared with the group against 14.2 gastrectomy (18.7 kg), reached a larger declines BMI (7,4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a better chance of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent against 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the studio stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone or the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study were obese people who underwent bariatric surgery, about 29 percent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared with a group that tried to more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone's reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here, this work is critical, because it indicates that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI," with no increase in the risk of death or kidney disease, states.
Blackstone also further claims that people and their doctors should start to take the weight really seriously, after a decline in the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long, with people expressing the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once the accumulation of these genetic changes that tightly integrate their bodies with obesity and diabetes, way back is no longer really hard.
"It is impossible for all came to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the question of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He argued that in the current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also pointed out that the Western European countries, though it was admirable, a refugee crisis in this situation was inadequate.
"It is impossible for all came to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in resolving the crisis, emphasized that it is only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is beautiful, but in the meantime, you have to think about the long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, particularly through education of Muslim countries," he pointed out.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force never solve these problems, "he added.
In addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama is also expressed in the actions of George Bush after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack and claims that the US has triggered a chain of violent reactions "uncontrollable events.
After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the way to solve this problem is not a violent way.
I know that his motives were good, but he used his power and created an unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.
Four-time increase in the number of children who ate sanitation agent for the last 4 years
Toxicology centres around the United States reported a nearly 400-percentage rise since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years old, which swallowed the highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the poison center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia's poison center, the number of ingestion of sanitation facilities for children under 12 years that have been reported to poison control centres, increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children to these products are getting more often, and unfortunately there is the percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation means intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
The videos on YouTube show teenagers how drink sanitation equipment because of cheap fuss.
Teenagers have reportedly mixed sanitation device with mouthwash containing alcohol for stronger drink.
Younger children may be drawn to attractive scent of appeal.
"Children don't think about it, that it might hurt them," said Lopez.
Many more attractive (sanitation funds) are those that are parfémovány.
There will be sanitation facilities with the scent of strawberries, grapefruit, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Sanitation device contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Particularly in young children may mean a few gulps of alcohol poisoning.
"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," he told Fox 4 in Kansas City, medical director of the poison center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
A glass of whiskey also would be left lying around, but these sanitation facilities will let people outside, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a 6-year-old girl who recently ate at school to four sips sanitation agents with the scent of strawberries and was rushed to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the thresholds deemed drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritcheyho, emergency doctor who cared for her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered slurred speech and wasn't able to walk after he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital on for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl because of alcohol fell and hit her head, cites Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother Nhaijah.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use of non-alcoholic products or arrange for them to be sanitation resources out of the reach of children.
Apart from alcohol poisoning were some sanitation facilities associated with death.
In 2013, two women die from Ontario after swallowing the sanitation device, which contained toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The medics thought that the product contains methanol, deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teachers deploying antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation facilities and banned their presence in the room.
The police examined the botched plan as "innocent chit-chat," and referred to the discipline of the school district.

The players who come in the summer, they have the whole pre-season period to settle in, which you can see in our own team this season.

Why I witnessed executions in Oklahoma City
Later today, despite a late legal intervention, will watch the slaughter of men.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't come to that, I'll be sitting in the death chamber viewing gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see Richard Glossipa, which will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me if I was one of the four officials who are going to be witnesses to his death.
I first received the invitation in January despite his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day coming up, I'm starting to get worried.
Why do I do it?
I accepted this invitation, because I think it's a good way to be able to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It offered me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because it is often more applications than positions, performs with morbid lottery, which will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will monitor the entire execution dispassionately.
That I can't do.
I'll sit alongside Richard Glossipa's closest friends, and I've developed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one of two-and-a-half-hour visit.
The boy I like.
Often we laugh when we speak.
The Prison Service says it can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, that I'm compromising its impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of an inmate in the way that he's open to the idea, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "was able to make it better," but I still think that what I was doing was wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things that I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if it did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him that I can ever be removed from the list of witnesses.
But he wants international journalists, who will be in place ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help procedures against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts, which I created.
I won't be here again all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have made him guilty of complicity in a criminal offence.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that it has not provided sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, it is the execution.
And it is from this perspective, I will follow his death.
I can't say that I'm really objective.
To this end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me, is the experience of what it's like to see the man I love die needless death.
The man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry after he rescued a man from Canning River.
Betting man from Petrhu that runs the police, came after he got into a shallow muddy the water just feet from the officers who had tried to persuade him to return back to shore.
The police were called in Canning Vale in the incident in excess in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, trying to get rid of the Canning across the river.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water and he said 'I'm not going out, just to take me'," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec you just wouldn't get wet uniform, so he tried to use safer and that police negotiating tactics. "
"People sometimes tries to do funny things during the escape," said Castledine.
The football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove the car into the ditch, to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the river Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but inspired by local to start planning the biathlon Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody says that the organisers tried to spy on him and is in danger of closing races
Peter Moody has accused the organiser Racing Victoria, that he tried to get a mole in the stable last year and has threatened to that immediately puts an end to racing.
He focused on the stewards and Racing Victoria integrity department and was based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with a late scratch Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which for him on Wednesday was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what's best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation as regards Lidarin positive swab of cobalt, who can't explain.
He bit his tongue on charges of spying for 18 months and he didn't want it to look like a "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about the fact that I sat on it for a long time, but I just feel so frustrated that it comes out of you all at once," said Moody.
They know that it went further.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
Today, I'm going to go home and get a good night's sleep.
I want to go out with my head up and to the owners thought they were doing the best for them.
When you start to think, then it shouldn't be a trainer.
He would then consider what I'll do my licence.
Previously, Moody said in his interview for racing.com bomb that the integrity department tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, whom I will call on the issue - and offered him a job in my stables to find out information about things that are in my stables are carried out," said Moody on Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should show all their information, because in an attempt to catch me completely failed.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of NI, David Moodie, the current chairman of NI, and Bernard Saundry, NI's current CEO, we were aware of it at the time, and they are aware of that, even today.
I think that it becomes a personal matter?
He NI grow some balls and arranges to people outside the coaching position they took responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
I'm for this industry a bad?
I'm really so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people here think that, yes.
Maybe I need to get my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying they will provide material for reflection.
But I got to the point when it doesn't matter to me, and it makes me sad.
It made me really sad.
I'm going to keep pushing and turning the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go away.
Levels of frustration coach will increase with the long-term investigation because of cobalt, including Lidari and recent scratches made him feel he could have his licence hours "on the table."
Mood, best known for designing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, described the rule on race day treatment as "ridiculous" after being administered to horses at the feet of clay tiles or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
Some of my team accidentally smeared it on his foot mud.
Could it have last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating tiles on the day of the race, for which they have already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules, he doesn't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back rivals because of lucha libre claim
Craig Bellamy, coach of the Melbourne Storm, criticized the actions of their players as "the plan" two NRL setting a premiership favourites.
Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters coach, said that the referee allowed players Storm "wrestlovat" his players during a controversial victory team Storm in the final qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, the coach of the Brisbane Broncos, done lightly veiled comment on Strorm after his team won the final qualification over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game a "tour" of rugby league and, according to him, two of Queensland were "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of their players and said that during those focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his self-esteem because he criticised his team's two leading trainers, which may mean that they fear of defeat from the Storm.
"It still comes - I don't remember that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling, when 24-2 beat us," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed much in the last year from our defensive system and techniques, the last few weeks we only put so much emphasis on contact during the crackdown, and that was the turning point for us.
Trent is already here for three years and obviously a great team of coaches, so probably isn't used to losing, which could be a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how these things always come in this annual part.
Bellamy depreciating Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentoru that Bennetovův team St George-Illawarra Dragons won a premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about an exciting football.
He was right in saying that Saturday's game was his similarly exciting as ours. It was as exciting, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George were criticised for being boring team and Wayne said at the time that he could care less.
But now has a team that can play a style of play, which he feels the cancellation, particularly his young midfielders with their speed.
That's the football you want to play, if you had to have this type of players.
This view said in 2010 and now wants to all teams played his style of football - but not every team has two linebackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they cannot play a style.
It makes me more confidence, because they say things like that, because they are worried about the struggle against us.
Six weeks ago, probably wouldn't even think about us when we were getting to the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the Storm and the Roosters fell more goals than in the game the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The game the Broncos team was probably good, I haven't checked, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game is over 20-18, in our game were another two attempts, but it's exciting football?
Or are the breaks and neskórování attempts that interesting?
According to me, it's the agenda.
As we mentioned, it means that they meet again at some stage.
Storm have this weekend break and won the right to host either Cownboys North Queensland or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park, tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.

"After reading the sworn statements from both parties, it is clear that put $200,000 bail for them is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts itself was manifestly inadequate, because the defendant failed to show up in court, he warned.
Maksimovicovi was granted bail on condition that he surrenders to Australian, so a Serbian passport, will report to police daily and adhere to a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

The Captain Arsenálu Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind the injured Jack Wilshere against Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also emphasized for Wilshere, that is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason to play again at Christmas.
The best-case scenario has already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four of the English game and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in next summer's European Championships, is clearly uncertain.
Too bad this nnejnovějšího problem is that Wilshere ended last season strongly after an ankle injury and then, once again came to the former forms during předsezóny.
"This is the kind of career-threatening injury," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It is not about nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or injuries he sustained before.
That might be true of a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk further injury, any player coming back anytime during the season.
Here, too, there is a disturbing pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. recorded 23 different injuries face since he was six years before its game debut.
Over the last five years, played in only 65-odd games Arsenálu out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 was one of two clubs in the Premier League, which has lost the most days because of injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal, believes that improvements in the area of the reported injuries during last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you're coming back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen their body and win the competition," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope that his body will stabilise, I'm sure, yes, and will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal begins campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb games with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday next Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his squad.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, it means that Mathieu of Arteta and probably will.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudem instead of Nacho Monreala Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and let the players who need it, breathe," said Wenger.
Even if Arsenal is the clear favourite to progress from Group F, in Zagreb's Maksimir reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo also haven't been defeated in a total of 41 matches after last season keep campaign "invincible."
The stadium on Wednesday night was shaken by the earthquake 3.2 degrees.
It was the 10th time this year in Zagreb for.
Wenger believes that Arsenal had learned from last season's Champions League, when capitulated against Monaco and he remains a distant hope that will lead the club to a first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is huge," says Wenger.
Arsenálu it never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The lack of a similar display in various show is striking, especially given how is the need for men to open up to more desperate than ever, in terms of suicides among young men in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death for men aged 20-45 years in Great Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, called the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) 2015 as Man of the Year, whose goal is to challenge the culture that prevents men seek help if necessary.
At the heart of this battle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression, found that in the event that the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends, "a healthy attitude," their chances of recovery has doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, represents a circle mentally healthy friends half a chance on the incidence of mental health problems.
But that friendship worked, first, of course, must be achievable.
In this communication through social media, with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often preferred a meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives doubled our need to be stronger, more fun-loving and more successful, even if we are in reality more isolated.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our actual values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as recently explained one billionaire and creator of the Games, the money really can't buy more luck.
The beauty of a series Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the figures was not defined by their work, but their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, while watching football on a comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stems from the realization that, yes, men can also identify with it, even though the majority are letting their feelings for each other.
I am one samaritánský worker explained: "... my role audience of people who feel depressed or have suicidal me really confirmed that even the smallest friendly interaction can make a difference."
Men who contact us, often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be seen as a weak to open up about the problems.
Friends are one of the shows, which arise in my mind when I'm trying to offer longer-term compensation mechanism.
It underlines the small moments in the male friendship.
As for my task, the outsider status on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term aid must come from a close distance, from a network of friends and family.
If you're planning on FrendsFest this weekend hosted by Comedy Central station, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk, where it will be celebrating the interior completely overhauled.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, a smile and say hello to him.
You never know what difference it can make your friendship.
The series Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central Station from beginning to end - a whopping 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest

But even if you get three points, it wasn't a classic performance team Laurent, was in front of the net and wasteful and later was replaced against his home team and the club where he started his storied career in 1999.
"The Champions League is not easy to win out or at home, so a win 2-0 makes our opponents problems and look comfortable in the defense is a good start, even if there are things that we have to improve with the passage of the season," said Blanc.
That is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we are about one or two more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the team at home, who earned a draw 2-2 this weekend with Bordeaux in League 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger has been identified as the man who will shift PSG in Europe to a new level since his move from Manchester United, which took place last month, and he showed why, when to pass a role for defense Malm Marc and beautiful ending up behind Johan Wilanda sent the ball into the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone had expected that it sets off a spectacular victory PSG, had to be disappointed.
Malmo, which beat Celtic in the play-offs and got to this stage, came with 9 International in the basic and five defenders and two linebackers were retracted a tough opponent.
But in addition to missile Nikola Djurdjice, which narrowly missed the far corner of the goal of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, it didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves benefited from an attack on the poor and miserable endings, which wasn't good, even from the, who couldn't even shot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed, because his shot into the net arrived shortly after the start of the second half.
However, they showed a much better when it came to training opportunities for his teammates, and it was just out of his passes when Di Maria sent Rotational missile, which ended in Wilandově goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavanimu, the Uruguayan sent a header over the line for the sixth goal this season after he after Ibrahimovic scored from the left wing from Maxwell.
That Malm ended any thoughts about the possibility that they could make something from the game, and only a superb save from a great distance Wilanda dashed the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged, even at a time when he had at the end of the match I Ezequiel unacceptable.
Age brigade team Malmo later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Norwegian, said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we've just played the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches is not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
For them, it was a fascinating game.

As the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency flares detonated Germany nearly nestmelila European crew, but it makes the ship to change course, he wrote the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided Monday to deal with the problem of refugees ahead: will be more systematically sort the migrants and asylum seekers, as soon as he steps on the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing about a future division of refugees under quotas on the basis of quantities that are increasingly remote from reality.
Six days after the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said 25 of the 28 EU countries to reallocate 160,000 refugees, changed the interior ministers of the Member States priority.
Rather than worry about the ultimate destination for refugees, is the first need to filter out those who arrive already today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary for the management of migration," stresses in the text projednaném ministers on Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis, the EU's common currency notes that is in danger in his next big integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but loses its determination and increases the pressure.
Restoring the border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power that makes clear that without it, there is no freedom of movement in Europe possible.
As evidence already served it to Austria and Slovakia on Monday on the measure.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are thinking about it, too, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary was introduced to it a long time ago.
This exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the rules of the Schengen.
That's a domino effect, but also the blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now effectively introducing mandatory entry checks in Greece, in southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already been through inland.
The French Interior Minister Bernard and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière about intensively acted during a private conversation with my three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is stiff.
In Italy, according to the unofficial statistics were already registered and identified taking fingerprints, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point in its territory, because they are afraid of more than others to remain in her shoulders camps where the refugees massed on its behalf.
The real black hole remains Greece.
On its islands close to the Turkish coast landed in this year of more than 200,000 people, which is more than twice the recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came direct from Syria, after having gone through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which are still in the financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, his hands folded in his lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and source of the now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Juncker's Commission promises to introduce checkpoints will take place as soon as possible, but did not mention any number, or date.
"The challenges faced by Greece, covering the whole of Europe," agreed on Monday to the mobilisation of EU interior ministers on this front.
It is therefore a matter to deploy SWAT teams in this country of European border control agency Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to expand its capacity for the reception of asylum seekers and to strengthen oversight of the islands.
"It will require adequate financial resources," warns the text put forward by ministers for approval.
From the point of view of the law will continue to have the last word in Athens.
The question of the creation of a real European border guards had not been officially raised, but Europe is a close second.
The new emergency 28s left as it moved to the back burner issue binding quotas and 160 thousands of refugees, which already has raised earlier in the year of the Commission and the European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They regard it as an attack on its sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was on Monday maintained in the text approved by a majority of twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the reallocation of 40 thousand refugees in the next two years, as it has already reached an agreement in June during the EU summit concludes Le Figaro.
