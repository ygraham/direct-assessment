In an emergency call, the professor admitted he shot his girlfriend
During a call to the emergency line with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come to their home.
Lamb has presided over that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably distraught, and that contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police, she found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on a white office paper: "I am so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she is the only one that ever loved me," it said in a letter signed by Lamb, according to authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot a favourite of Professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said staff at the university heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fatal phone call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
In the end, there was another death; Lamb took his own life when police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, with mandated authorities still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
Details that were published by investigators on the state and students and staff who knew him together created an image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were enjoying his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, in thanks to "great people," with whom he shared academic life.
The two were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and history, along with other 17 faculty members, and many students went on courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there have been insights into problems.
The student who raised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitating and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was experiencing stress at the end of the academic year of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University on leave for health reasons, when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate in which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
President of the University William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba seemed to be in trouble."
Lamb will not answer those questions.
After he left campus, police intercepted his lead as he crossed the border of Arkansas back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb was killed by a single shot from a gun in the backyard of a house about a mile from his parents on the outskirts of Greenville in Mississippi, confirmed by the coroner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb drove to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3500 students in the city, which numbered about 12000 people, in 2009, and taught geography and hours of education.
He got a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of long-time friends Lamba described him as a clever, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older kid who tutored her for a few years playing guitar.
It was quite a heartbreaker then.
The hearts of all the girls softened as soon as he appeared, "says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for some time.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but the record of the wedding never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick home that adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier river.
Police said the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew Lamb was interested in music and playing the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were evicted at the summer festival three years ago.
They later played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, spoils a lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the sweat that Lamb had played on the guitar and harmonica for the unruly crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We were lashing out and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slain professor, led the seminar in his first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boyhood student club and the government of students.
In Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, took part in commemorative events with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended vigils, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police are now claiming that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there was no evidence that they were actually sedated.
Toys R Us plan to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us claim they don't waste as many seasonal workers as last year, but the producer of children's toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work off more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centres across the country, a decline from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start with a recruitment process this month, and staff will be recruited during October-December.
While vacations alone are months away, the shopping holiday season is coming, and companies are preparing to temporarily hire staff to help in shops and sales, for sending and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his' date 'with Princess Diana
The Premier "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realised that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that the Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in time."
The film begins and I realize that I am within reach of something that could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in time," is a documentary about "Return to the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemecki and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The prime minister's "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's certainly the best travel document ever made for me."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict's nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
Once again, the head of the UN has urged all parties, including a divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation impossible."
Ban called on five permanent members to show solidarity and unity they showed in reaching Iran's nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 election figures showing Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to identify him as a man who often changes his mind.
The rest of them waved a hand like an unbeaten joke.
And some prepare for implosion.
But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not doing it (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead on a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what that means for the nominating chances of this magnate in the area of real estate.
Of course, it is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that, at this time of 2011, the lead of Rick Perry's path to the rise of Herman Caine, ultimately neither of them won the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into general elections.
But outside groups such as the Super PAC Jeb Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and begin to interpret their dollars at a halt with the aim of toppling him.
Here are some recent poll numbers suggesting that the real-estate tycoon is not just a fleeting phase:
Trump's assessment of the positive has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, it showed a vote by Monmouth University that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive look at this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, that was 40 percent.
At the start of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Around three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are held in the early stages.
After voting for the University of Quinnipiac, which passed last week, it found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two of 10 said they would be "indignant" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson produces roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "thrilled" against the 40 per cent who say the same about Trump).
Another closest at the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "distraught" if the favourite of Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his nastiness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationwide inclined to think that the real estate has the magnate's right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's ABC News / Washington Post.
The same number is held in the state's Iowa State Club, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong to the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When he puts on his savvy hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best option, according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
By this time in the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as an award-winning candidate against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Even if Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump equally defeats almost everyone.
Some pundits emphasize that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused between more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey from the start of September shows that in a hypothetical direct contest between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always majority support.
He leads above Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points at each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who defeats him?
Ben Carson would lead over the businessman on a wide 19 points in a hypothetical game of one against one.
The bare majority of Donald Trump's followers claim that they have already made their point.
A new Tuesday's CBS / NYT poll shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump claim they won't change their mind.
It's obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep an open backdoor for change between candidates.
Yet Trump is the current strongest opponent of his outsider's fellow neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice more likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Indeed, ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "thugs" in the announcement speech of his campaign, immigration still stands as the main and central topic of the 2016 conversation.
Some worry that Trump's drudgery will lure key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage to rebranding.
But according to a new Monday poll by ABC / Post, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration at the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now receive roughly half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday's ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
A vote by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellish angry."
The House has supported a greater share of the state from the levy on coal.
The Czech Republic will acquire more than 400 million.
The House of Commons at first reading supported the government's amendment to the top bill, which regulates the amount of revenue from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister John Mousdek (ČSSD) has promised MPs that it will raise money in addition to both the Treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
The draft has been criticised by MPs who worry that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the community as yet, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budgeting. The House in first reading has supported the government's new top law, which in addition to other means that the state should receive a greater share of the proceeds of the levy on the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The state's share will rise to 67 per cent, while the municipality's share will be reduced from the current 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The draft is also changing the way to calculate reimbursement for the minerals that companies extract.
The change in fees for mining operations is to bring to the Treasury about $427 million more than in 2013.
The government's revenue budgets are to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, commuters received from fees of about $450 million and a state budget of $150 million.
From the extraction of brown coal, there were around 200 million kronor and a state of 66 million kronor.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the amount of recovery in excess of EUR 1000 per hectare per hectare per year.
The income from these remittances remains in its entirety.
Industry Minister John Mousdek (ČSSD) told MPs that commuters would gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million kronor.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but it is set by the government by its regulation.
The payment shall be recalculated as a product of the amount of the mineral extracted and the rates for the different types of mineral.
According to the Government, the reason for the change is that of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, MEP Mark Benda warned that the pricing of the levy by the government does not need to be in line with the constitution.
But, according to Secretary of Youth, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging a nerve that is state-owned.
The fees are received only by municipalities whose territories are affected.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, there will be three-quarters of the community's money and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive rock extraction.
Part of the money that the state will collect on mining fees will be assigned.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide a year-long rescue service.
The draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would hurt communities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kucera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the community as yet, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It's not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to make the Minister of Finance improve the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
Prior to the increase in unemployment at Mosteck, Mrs KSČM warned Hana Aulicka.
Kádner and Aulicky have failed to dismiss the amendment, and he wanted the law to return the government to finishing.
In the explanatory memorandum, it says that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees is not reflected in coal prices, because prices are from more than 90 per cent in the long term.
Thus, major consumers like power plants or theaters should not feel price growth.
"On the other hand, this really increases the risk that the mining organisations will offset the increase in reimbursement by trying to reduce their operating costs, which in particular would reduce the number of employees," the government admits.
However, the increase in fees in terms of employment is manageable.
According to the rapporteur, the amendment to Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial that MPs have yet to know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.
If coal is also benefiting from the limits, then it will have implications for yields for both the state and the community, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with the youngster in that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fail until after 2020.
The limits on CSA below should be broken for reasons of social, economic, and, because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy to lead the Czechs as the one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four English tennis players will appear at Thursday's drawing of a barrage of the Davis Cup in India on the whiteboard, and this time each of them is likely to be hit in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil planned to spread the load on the whole quartet given the difficult conditions.
There is heat and high humidity in Delhi, so they expect difficult fights that can stretch to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I want to spread it out by the weather.
And from what it's gonna look like, he told Navrátil in today's practice of Czech selection in the center of the arts, Kumar Khana.
With the one-to-one team and the world's 40-year-old South, he reckons Friday and Sunday's two games.
The position of the pair is likely to be because of Lukas Rosol and Radek Stephen.
I want everyone involved.
I've got it slowly in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech assembly should be Stephen's participation in Saturday's four-game.
It's just a question of who will stand next to the experienced detractors, who have an 18-4 record in the Davis Cup quarter.
It's probably not.
There are options with Rosolem or Adam Pavlace.
"I really don't know who and how it's going to be," Navrátil said.
He will decide, according to the development of the two games.
The variation may be Pavlasek, with a Merry surprise in the 1-1 win in the debacle over the Australians.
"He's a decent asshole," said Navrátil.
I've done it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to show the same performance I've shown there since the second set.
"I am happy for those experiences and I would like to bring a point," Pavlasek said.
The home put in two games by Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ladder), which he won last week by a ger in Shanghai, where he defeated the players in the third and fourth hundred of the ladder.
The pair will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both are players from the Challengers and ours have the experience of the ATP Tour, but we have been convinced many times that the rankings in the Davis Cup have not been decided.
"He decides the current form, the weather," Navrátil said.
Friday's opening two games will begin at 6: 30 p.m. and can stretch due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it has rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it may be possible to play artificial lighting.
It has already ignited and it has some two thousand luxuries, which is enough.
"It should be put under the lights," Navrátil said.
Jeremy Corby will debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corby's debut in PMQ is very enthusiastically expected
New Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and will for the first time be working with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will put the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully scrutinised by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he asked "fewer theatres and more facts."
He also said he could skip several sessions he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the singing of the national anthem in the service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the newspaper's headline pages.
Mr Corby's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he would "stand in respectful silence" and that he would acknowledge "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that a Labour leader would recommend the national anthem to sing "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corby's top team, quoting differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says political differences in the work are also "staged" following the appointment of Mr Corby over his position in the European Union and the government's benefit cap.
Mr Corwas said at the TUC conference that the Labor Party had presented amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the benefit cap.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party was "very clear" opposing government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labor Party, who has faced David Cameron over the past decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Workers' Party, which promised a different approach to policy, says he has ideas "from the crowd" to questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North says the PMQ is too confrontational and that it will refrain from both the "post-finished response," and the ozzy trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he does not attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea that he would let other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he had heard that he had discussed the matter with the Speaker of the House, John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to divert from the style of politics of "Punch and Judy," which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later, he admitted he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the judgement of leaders, their leadership of the House and their stance among other MP, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature, and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photos in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a hard place to homelessness.
But one group of former children of the street found a way to learn something and earn a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to make photos of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of this project.

Pound rises while wage growth in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped the following data and showed the recovery of UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was driven higher by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB's profits, including bonuses, rose 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009 and it looked like they were approaching estimates when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after receiving an approach from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and approach brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from rival group luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's recent sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had risen by $2.5bn using shared positioning as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest drop on the index and fell 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the company to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports firm reported an 83% jump in mid-year in profits before tax of £46.6m
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
Executive chairman JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in its company, it says.
The cost could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague landslide of the marsh are cheering.
The controversial building has been given a stoppage.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
A petition has been held against the building, which is due to come close to the Ania monastery in the centre of Prague, protesting in front of the Office of Prague.
The Municipality held in the decision that there had been a breach of the building law because all the elements of the territorial decision had not been complied with.
"The territorial decision in question does not contain, for example, the type of land, the distance from adjacent buildings, sufficiently clearly and comprehensively described in the shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory concerned by the construction," it is written in its decision.
It also considers that some of the elements for the decision were originally published in the present dossier, but which has changed.
For example, it is the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be created on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It is clear from the writing material that, however, the owner of the land has provided only consent to the design documentation for the territorial procedure, not consent to the placement of the construction on its premises, the Department of Construction is writing.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta of the Department of Auditors, the Department of Construction did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Regional Development, that the deadline for the initiation of the review had already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," said Razetto, in a press release.
The project, which people have dubbed the marquee because of the supposedly proposed color of the facade, is causing strong emotions in Prague.
In the city centre, hundreds of people have been killed in protest against the building.
The association and residents of nearby houses are concerned that some permits were issued for a house many years ago, which was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the inadequacy of the building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Atan monastery.
The house was designed by the architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original design of the 2008 project, which was envisaged with a glass façade, was rejected on the basis of the National Historical Institute (NPIs) of the Ministry of Culture and repealed the authorisation of Prague memorials in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-to-face windows but NPIs and the master's memorabilia were approved and a building permit was issued on that basis.
The author rejects the rebuke of opponents, saying he never envisaged the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname for pink-and-white diabetes.
The Czech politician has given up migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail, too.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the trip, he took three Syrian refugees along with the crew, which they said they wanted to move about half a mile.
At that time, it was not criminal in Hungary, he claimed.
We knew that the guardians of the law would not do such an act.
But when the officers stopped us, to our surprise we were arrested and taken into custody in Szeged, he described the paper.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours.
The police said they were correct, but they were bound to communicate, because they didn't have too good English.
But prison was being trialled.
In our cell, for example, about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were weighed down.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or four-year-old girl.
These people had been locked there for a second day, and no one knew what to do with the language barrier, Berg said.
What mustn't they confiscate?
Ask the president of the execution chamber.
On Friday, 18.9, from 9: 30, answering questions to readers will be answered by the president of the execution chamber of the Czech Republic Mgr. Pavel Fučíková.
You can ask her for changes to the law enforcement powers from September 1, 2015 as well as to other things related to executive or bailiffs.
Metcash launches campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash launches campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the start of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are boosting relationships with local food suppliers and building a brand of IGA by marketing in mainstream and social media and events like the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are joining with brands like them on Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tasting in the IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the retailer's food, alcohol and hardware will celebrate its annual investor's strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because South and Western Australia represent almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA business actions and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and business IGA is taking a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will tap into 5 per cent of the food market in these two states during the 12 months since the opening of the first deals that took sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in its report, Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the retail of IGA could lose $360 million on annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
That prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes at a fixed price basis Metcash could cost him around $13 million in pre-tax returns, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share of markets in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest poll by Roy Morgan found that shoppers in the IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks sales of food Metcash will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said trading lunches in Melbourne could be "highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglas's comment.
But it is known that a board member of Metcash contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of the IGA has dropped from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and earnings from the food store Metcash, which delivers about 1200 retailers IGA, have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculations, as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has switched to counter-attack and invest more than $150 million a year to meet the pulse prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and helps so retailers IGA re-equip the business by adding fast-growing food and news from the privateers.
The executive director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that price-comparison programs and dovish business will catch up with the slump and hopes that wholesale returns will return to basic profit growth of profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis bolstered by President Tennis Australia's Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behaviour rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side-loss in recent fuss about his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behaviour rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated by a referee, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka had one to stretch to Kyrgios and I should have stretched him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after a cramp wrecked him possible by Richard Gasquette at the US Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth on location in the second two game behind Bernard Romic in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely that in my opinion, Thanasi has been a little bit drawn into the controversy," Healy says.
He destroyed the rocket when he lost for a hamstring in the US, but he's not the first player to pick up anger on his rockets, because I know Thanasi well enough, and I can say he's not going to be proud of this event.
But he really controlled himself very well because he was in the US subject to a very provocative circumstance because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves great credit.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he has been treated somewhat hard with him.
He's a very grown-up 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits well into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's been very respected in the dressing room, he's been in amazing shape, he's a very stable and mature young kid and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important game, which begins on Friday, stating that "mutual decision" is the right solution for all but supports the hometown of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term stand-off.
"First of all we want our team to be absolutely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that around him [Kyrgios] was created," Healy says.
And I think that Nick rose very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the eyes of the public rapidly growing, he has also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight when he can think about it, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closing borders and holding migrants
Following the announcement of the state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who attempted its illegal crossing to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in the country of no one and the Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
Those who have been stranded for an unknown time on the strips of the country between two states are those fleeing violence in their native countries, building their tents and settling down.
But there comes a sense of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together call "Open the border!" And give the order of the Hungarian police force.
Some in protest refuse food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister claims it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
It will need to be discussed with Brussels and other countries in the next few days, "says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after a block of 28 states did not come up with a unified immigration policy on continuing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in the surprise Italy and Greece, and spoke with the hope of reaching a possible deal next month or the end of the year that the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German federal chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called a special EU European summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Nevertheless, Hungary has not committed its hopes to Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of danger in the two southern regions gave the authority a greater authority to tackle the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and accelerate judicial cases of discussing asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News Corrections Charlie D'Agata reported that even the inmates were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point into the European Union for Refugees, many of whom have fled from Syrie and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary are now criminalizing a breach of the 4-metre fence that the government has placed on the southern border with Serbia, and also sets longer jail terms for those who illegally convert refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government is announcing the state of emergency," a spokesman for the government of Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged told reporters.
In this we are absolutely clear: Illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military expected next week, but reporters in the Associated Press on the border observed the heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, an adviser to Orban for the home defence, said the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 were caught already in the state's territory.
They have penetrated the fence and are now in police custody charged with committing offences under new laws.
Authorities quickly let the fence fix.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with barbed wire.
There was chaos in the main border crossing at the ROKOKE, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and created the crowding of people.
About 20 went in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary as they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Head of Hillary Clinton before Bernie Sanders reduced by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her head start.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (a drop of 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, is gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competition, the most Democratic voters claim it is too early to say that they are clearly the decision to support the candidate.
But the sponsors of Clinton are more certain of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since CBS News last month, Clinton has lost ground on several demographic groups while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton keeps a big head start between women and moderates, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is losing only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated, and now Sanders is equal.
But Clinton still has a big lead because of older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead in front of Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters in the entire states say she would enthusiastically support Clinton if she becomes a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 per cent would support it only for being a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps it is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly passionate about her.
Views are mixed among those that currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favourite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When supporters of Clinton are asked in the open question of why they want her as a candidate, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), following that it's time for her to be president of the woman (13 percent), and that she's the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Supporters of Clinton also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also cited by the great possibility of election and agreement on issues.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidacy for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would want him to do so - a third of them think he shouldn't run.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as a second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the most common choice.
Among supporters of Clinton, she said more than half of Bidens as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will extend from 20 points when Biden will run, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the general election; but that number dropped from 78 percent from last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely selector is increasing.
However, when there was a question of the greater importance of a candidate, Democratic voters prefer to address problems from greater chances of being elected.
Like last month, neither a Democratic candidate or potential candidate emerges as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, then twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that view.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.
As for all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as state secretary continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying that their overall view has not affected her at all.
But among the American public, this is an overall different story.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on the subject were split in March, shortly after that problem emerged.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no bearing on their overall view of Clinton, while at 36 percent, their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 say their opinion on Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among the voters of her party, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six Test candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were best placed in honesty.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters have not made an opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson quit behind Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in latest CBS News / New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half the electorate in the latest survey and others are left looking for support.
Voters from Republicans across the country continue to support Trump overwhelmingly, and have climbed from 23% of the support in the last CBS poll conducted ahead of the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is leading the charge across demographic groups, and eliminates the Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the governor of Ohio's John Kasich, is behind, along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker entirely on the roster from 10% support fell to the current 2%.
Former governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was held in September.
The latest CNN / ORC poll published last week showed that Carson has improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans for Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News / Washington Post also showed that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
On the rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot blindly at the retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump declared last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of a student in the first year of Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died during a pre-mining fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, charges of murder against five people have been filed.
Members of the fraternity of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michael" Deng during the start of the ceremony in September 2013 and delayed him to hospital, which contributed to his death, police reported.
The police allege that he had blindfolded, he was wearing a backpack full of sand on a total weight of £30 and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach goal over the frozen field.
Mr Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's dress, googling his symptoms and contacting Andy Menga, a nationwide president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris VAGNER said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and essentially put the welfare of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng repeated a blunt object to the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overcrowding in the fraternity, and at least one student is dying every year because of the overload since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
The Brotherhood and their members must be accountable, and this step is important from the authorities.
A grand jury of Monroe County has recommended charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with assault by overcrowding and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to contain not only the persons involved, but in case there is an organisation that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will push them to accountability, too," Wagner said at a Tuesday news conference.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity abolished its relationship with local affiliates.
This with the tents when the Fed raises interest rates
Growth rates will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it will take.
For the economy, it specifically offers the history of the little originator about the timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first rate rise and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggression in raising rates is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets react.
This is why US central bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not be confused about when the rate hike will begin, but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
There are indeed more variables in the game.
However, in the end, the members of the market can make sure that all the fuss because of an increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be some interpreted as the end of an era of 'cheap money,'" he said in a note to clients Julian Jessop, lead global economist at Capital Economics.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to be more common but still low, creating a seismic shock that many might fear.
That means there will be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in the past around a month, the expected rate hike may make the air a little volatile.
But, once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend to recap stocks after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a lag in monetary policy," said analysts at Deutsche Bank in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed hike.
In fact, the market for the last roughly 35 years is often the most - about 14 per cent - heading into a rate rise in relatively flat in 250 days (average gains of 2.6 per cent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with the average yield of 14.4 per cent from the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis of Bob Dolla, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle, and the return is beginning to decrease.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but raising rates often helps.
Currently, the Fed faces some conditions that have not yet existed, and which could precipitate recession.
Most notable is that gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history in raising the Fed rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal annual increase in GDP was below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few expected its retention when it was at just 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, the Atlanta Fed says.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and could discover the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready to grow the Fed for a year and all eyes turned to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all of the increase cycles so far have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the counting recovery," it writes in the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those that the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, we are now at 74 months and still continuing.
The fixed yield was also volatile as the market expects an increase in rates, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stock is experiencing.
The key difference is that the impact is more rapid on bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes the direction of policy.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase / reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields, they fall immediately, "Deutsche said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that an increase in rates will cause returns between long- and short-dated bonds, equal to a curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, though "we are still cautious about straining the yield," Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusting to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are few signs that the market has adjusted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flat, the credit margin has widened, and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that carry out most of their business in the US will win interest rates after raising interest rates, and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with lots of debt are going to get worse as the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be larger.
"History shows that the" quality "of shares tends to be overcome over the course of three months after the initial rate increase," analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a report for clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets were overtaken by weak balance-sheet companies in every interest-rate hike in 1994, 1999, 2004, on average, by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts on average by 4 (percentage points), or 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of purely stock games, consumers also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers can see their profits also through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised this station for "deafening"
He takes the view that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they just cheat Brits
Retired colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and says neither is an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" in Classic FM, the leading MP says, piling fresh pressure on the broadcast to show that they are doing something that commercial broadcasters do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that radio station public services seemed to be "deafening" and was increasingly indistinguishable from his business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word" deafened "- but it seems to be changing on Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year seem to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - this is two examples that attack me when you're actually just mimicking what we already have on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
The director-general of the BBC has rejected the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its trade rival in terms of live music and education to the public.
What I learned about classical music on Radiu 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and making music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radia 3 to find new music and putting in new works into operation is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, the regulator told BBC Councillor 3 Alan Davey that it was now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production, which came under fire for the tread on the heels of commercial competitors during the broadcast of the Culture, Media and Sports, and were given a hearing by the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
See why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which September stars Paloma Faith ABoy George as judges - was made "in a manner typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from his own stable" if he next starred in a fun series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers' royalties on other formats of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and the blame may be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 have seen a 7% rise in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth since 2000 began
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November Black Friday could be the reason for braking spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and it has become a ghost town from many of Britain's main streets.
However, experts claim there are signs of steady online sales, and new figures show a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on August was the lowest increase in growth since the early measurements of 2000, with an increase of just 5% compared to last year.
Experts claim there are signs of steady online sales, and new figures show a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the past years and you go back to 2000, it has always been rationalised over time," it says to Guardian Andy Mulcahy, the editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explains that internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones for performing purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to implement purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) has been somewhat stagnant, and it seems to have subsided.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was relegated from America, is cited as one reason for falling sales.
Experts believe customers could delay purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times more than the average shopper has turned on its computers to make purchases and agree several websites of sellers.
Experts believe Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers are bargaining again, can hold customers away from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was spent online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than one-third of sales are done via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried victims of falling crane in Mecca and the Bin Laden family have been sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets of Muslims in the execution of the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly blamed for the collapse of the construction magnate of the Saudi Binladin Group.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crash of a crane in the Grand mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed to some degree in white, mourners picked their way and gave up respect for the victims when the first of the fallen was on their last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moais.
The sad message was passing around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the building crane breached the ceiling of the mosque and toppled to the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral and the Saudi king was sanctioned by a building group of bin Laden's family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
Bodies of 29 dead after crane crash in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before launching the annual pilgrimage of Haddock.
Saudi officials have already promised that Haddock to Mecca will be held and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the shoulder of the crane at the top when it was not in operation.
The Arabic version of the Order, made by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, states that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English service agency did not report this detail, but said the company's bosses had been banned from travelling abroad.
Early this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crash of a crane into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims cowered before the execution of Hadi later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statement on the collapse of the crane and were not given any comment by its representatives for comment.
The Royal Order also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.
Binladino's family have been in the vicinity of Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and have run major building projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade that the family had renounced in the 1990s.
The crash happened in the midst of strong winds and rain just days before leaving millions of people in the kingdom at a pilgrimage, which must at least once in their lives go through every strong muslim.
Officials say 158 people still remain in hospital.
Officials determined that there would be one million riyals (£174,000) dedicated to relatives of those killed, and the same amount for permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half that amount.
Head of B & Q says East Europe's traders working for the left-leaning trend
Britons increasingly employed by craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is an open 200 Screwfix store targeting shoppers
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B & Q outings across the country
Compiled by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting up hammers and brushes and passing them on to the employed educated East European artisans to work at their home
If you're going with a hammer or a paintbrush, it seems you're in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employed by craftsmen to carry out the kudos work at their home, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B & Q.
Veronique Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, which owns the home-needs chain, says that a large increase in the number of skilled traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting shoppers, and closes 60 B & Q outings.
Ms Laury claims she wants to employ more women in B & Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store do better half.
Currently, the majority of male workers are male.
She said there was a need to address rising demographic trends that depicted more female households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Ms Laury says: "We still work mostly men in the shops.
We need to get closer to the balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% decisions on merchandise purchases.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies under Britain's FTSE100 index, has also re-structured her top team to reflect the equivalence between directors of men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among staff including the executive and finance director.
Ms Laury claims: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women we would take to us.
Kingfisher announced the fall in mid-year profit and sales after the group took on the cost of closing the business.
The result of a trend of Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q, is to open 200 new stores
December's £600 pension is at risk.
"It's a justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
Prime Minister Zbynek Stanjura noted that a one-off contribution was good, but in the long run it would be better to be in the standard indexation because it would be reflected in the next few years.
"We have room to find the mechanism by which we arrange it," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michael Marks (ČSSD), according to which it was scheduled to roll over the bill next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that the better social situation of retirees is not pink.
Higher indexation next year would mean a budget impact of $5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every hundreds of millions.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, the right, recalled that in the past the rate of indexation had decreased.
Rapporteur Miroslav Opwar (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction in real pensions in 2016 and later.
The veto of the right-hand payout in December will significantly complicate and possibly make it impossible, he said.
As a result, the chairman of ČSSD Roman Greenbelt suggested shortening the time limit for the committee's standards for ten or 20 days, as well as to block the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the total to £1.73 billion.
The money is to go from the Department of Work and Social Affairs in particular.
In the coming year, pensions should rise to an average of about a century.
The allowance should be given by the pensioner's people, who will be eligible for a pension or part of it in December.
Even those who died in December would be able to get a pension before paying for it.
However, they would have to apply in writing, by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions are rolling in the Czech Republic on a regular basis in January, with price rises and a third of real wage growth.
This year the pension is 41.5 per cent gross salary, next year it should be 40.5 per cent.
For old-age pensions, the state spent $314.7 billion last year, according to the state's final account, which was roughly five billion year-on-year.
Spending on retirement pensions accounted for 26 per cent of all budget spending and 46 per cent of all spending mandatory from the law.
The average full retirement income increased last year, according to data in the state's closing account by 104 to 10.714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payout of 2.4 million full retirement pensions and about 17,000 relative pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
The Senate seat was almost certain, according to Russian media.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the Western-Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governors, Nikolai Cukanov, as the party's candidate for United Russia, defended his post in Sunday's election.
According to Russian law, senators do not elect citizens, but it selects them from a trio of candidates to announce their names before gubernatorial elections.
After the election, he then selects the Senate from a trio of candidates.
The complication was for Jakunina's fact that he did not live in the Kaliningrad area for twenty years, as required by law.
For Jakunina, the Kremlin has found an exception to being an extraordinary and empowered ambassador, which is not covered by the legal requirement of long-term residence.
It ended the filming of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger.
The last straw in the resolution of the main hero is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, which has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother-Iva Janrobe decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
John is understood to be with his wife, Olga - Efox Balzer on a similar path.
He remembers that he used to have his own will and dreams, he wants to be dignified and free to live again.
He is eager to regain control of his life - and, as a solution, choose an escape from that background, he said to the story of Nightingale.
Bajgar wanted a comedy form to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners doesn't feel quite free.
From the start, it was clear that the main role would be to Bartok, with whom he had already collaborated on the Unseen.
Yet he said the actor, who had appeared in front of the camera for a longer break associated with convalescence after a serious illness, surprised.
We talked to each other three years ago.
I gave him the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me that he seemed to be a rounded sportsman.
In fact, before filming the next scene, he asked where he was going to sit.
This time he was riding his bike, climbing the rocks and even walking down the hill.
And all in record tropical highs, the director noted.
According to Bartoka, women take a tiger to make a rabbit out of it over time.
They feed him a little bit of feed, but they close the door so he doesn't think to play it outside the rabbit hole on the tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film, commentating on the actor.
His wife, who may act slightly negatively on the spectators, has portrayed Ella Balzer.
She's not just a negative figure.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and mean well.
But at the same time, he's an usurper, and he wants to take care of his husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of Jane's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Tanya Vilhelm and Pavel Beret - and the zebras of Eric and Pepper - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohook.
The producer of the film is Peter Erben of Logline Production, the co-producers of Czech television and the Radio and Televizia Slovakia.
Google has promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
US internet company Google has promised to provide a further up to $5.5 million ($132.6 million) to organisations that help thousands of refugees streaming into Europe.
It announced on Tuesday Google.org, which is a charitable odour of this internet company.
Azerbaijan has abolished Teliq's part of the visit for criticism of human rights abuses.
The Czech member of the European Parliament for the Movement, Paul Telik, has postponed the forthcoming Thursday trip to Baku, because the Azerbaijani authorities have now cancelled the official part of the visit.
Baku, according to Telic, is justifying the EP resolution of last week, which criticizes human rights abuses in Azerbaijan and has been co-authored by Telic.
The decision of the Azerbaijani side of Telika has lost the possibility of talks with official partners as well as a visit to political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, explained in a press release of its Brussels office.
The trip, which had been scheduled several months in advance, wanted Telik to be used to meet with the leadership of parliament and representatives of the executive, as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to TIME.
The EP resolution condemns "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan."
It urged European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent ruling over Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadian Ismaille, who has campaigned to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out visiting Novosibirsk that in the future the Russian air base in Syria would emerge.
We don't have such plans yet.
But nothing is ruled out, he said.
In Syria, Russia already has an airport naval base in the port of Tartus, which it has yet used more as a service and logistics centre.
But according to reports of the Russian press, from the start of August, the supply of Russian weaponry and military material to Syria has risen.
According to Moscow, there are arms shipments resulting from the trade agreements in force.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to set up an air base at the city of Latakiya, which for now remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
Washington, however, is not entirely clear about the specific military intentions of Russia in Syria, US commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov, it was their third phone conversation in the past ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow to convey concern about the gathering of Russia's arsenal in the vicinity of Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the support of ASADA by Moscow for a lost bet.
On Russia's policy objectives in Syria, he said they were rather vague.
Moscow has made its satellite out of Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is supposed to be the main issue of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today's speculation in the Russian press.
The Russian leader, on the other hand, said he was not going to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbass.
According to today's report by the New York Times, the US government does not rule out President Barack Obama with the Russian president during a UN meeting.
But opinions among White House aides are said to have diverged so far.
The TASS news agency today with a recall to the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has written that Putin has not yet been on the agenda of his New York stay meeting with Obama.
Sesame oil on a greyhound diet, hemp helps strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the flow of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressing for cold seeds, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
That's why these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallstones.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for preventing cardiovascular disease.
These, according to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, have been the most common cause of Czechs "deaths for several years.
Bile inflammation afflicts mainly women, helps sesame oil.
If you are among the Asian cuisine lovers, you must not miss the sesame oil in the pantry, which is part of the original recipe for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of the dishes and has a range of favourable health effects.
It is often used in bile diets.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of bile stones.
These are from 90% cause of bile inflammation, and women suffer these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
Generally, the problems with gallstones relate particularly to overweight people who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be used with the success of the liver diet, which is very similar to that gall bladder.
If people want to use all the health benefits it brings to the consumption of this oil, they should be wary of merchandise from the exotic grocery store.
The producers of Asia often use roasted seeds that have a sharper flavour.
Oil, however, will lose all active substances, described by Ladislav Hačecký, executive director from Czech firm Bohemia Olé of Kraslic on Sokolovsk, which produces bio-virgin oils pressed for the cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame seeds.
In an hour, he'll be able to pick up eight pounds of seed.
By mechanical pressing the raw material will heat up to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the label of the extra virgin.
At higher temperatures there would be a loss of nutritional substances.
Sunflower oil thrives on diseased hearts and arteries.
The Czech favourite among the oils is sunflower.
The Jarmily Hamerski research, which led to Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents preferred him in the warm kitchen.
In fact, he is not suitable for frying, at 180 ° C, he is starting to burn.
It is better to use it, for example, to catch salads and throw in particular in a diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.
In fact, it contains a high proportion of omega-6 saturated fatty acids, which are most likely to lower cholesterol levels from all fatty acids.
On heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of overall intake fat and calories.
For example, in one spoonful of sunflower oil is 62 calories, in a spoonful of rapeseed oil is 99 calories.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to recognize that natural foods with nutritious substances than so-called empty calories are much more appropriate.
These are part of an industrial-engineered product.
It is therefore appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts as much as the sesame and hemp nine months.
Storage in the fridge will still extend the shelf life.
Old oil people identify, in particular, bitter taste.
On the contrary, he was not at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp tend to be the so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is believed to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This mark owes the highest content of omega 3 and omega-6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot make the body itself, and one must accept them from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that the daily intake of this substance is inadequate.
The men in France and Greece will consume it 0.6 grams, and the Icelanders will accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is suitable to be included in the diet as part of a support diet to boost immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is a necessary part of cell membranes.
People do not need to worry about the use of hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil path has been found for consumers is confirmed by the fact that in the company of Bohemia Olé is one of the best sellers.
500 grand a year.
People often use one spoonful of fasting after the wound.
Hemp oil is not flavour-specific, but it will make a great boost to the immunity, advised by Daniel Wolves of the kraut-based company Bohemia Olé.
According to the statistics, the most passionate nation is grilled by the Americans.
For one household, there are 1.4 grills.
All over the world, there are all sorts of contests in the grilling that only confirms the success of this culinary discipline.
Nor are the Czechs behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the English market, we find that only 4% of people have not been grilled in their lives.
The vast majority are then grilled a few times a year.
To make the grilling successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - ideal to trim the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the best thing to do and at the same time, at the barbecue, will it leave the health of a beneficial substance?
In general, the grilling process itself should be economical with fat.
Experts agree that much of the oil begins to lose its flavour at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also come from the body of beneficial substances that we otherwise gain from eating the oils from the dishes adjusted at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra virgin oils won't find their applications during the grilling.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, experts from Bohemia Olé of Kraslic on Sokolovsk will immediately recall grape oil.
It complements the flavour of the masses and the fish.
In the kitchen, it features a unique characteristic of raising the natural flavour of the meal.
It also is suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 ° C.
Even at such a high temperature, as one of the few oils preserves the health of the beneficial substance, it describes the benefits of the grape oil of Daniel Wolf of Bohemia Olé, which belongs to a few of the English producers of this wine grape.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the positive content of these substances, it helps lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By eating grape oil we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, it is used in the treatment of acne and helps to care for dry and broken hair.
Chef Ramsay appreciates the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it appropriate for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when eating salads, but also for the heat treatment of the dishes.
So the grill can be used in two ways, marinating and barbecuing itself.
By marinating the meat and fish, we preserve their succulence.
Three components must be present when preparing the marinade: Oil, acidity and spices.
The acidity will be delivered by apple vinegar, for example, and thus achieve a softening of the meat.
The spice adds a mass of flavour and oil to preserve and delivers the right thinness, advising Daniel Wolves.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is downright ideal for marinating because, as one of the few oils, it can pass through dark meat.
So the marinated meat or fish are ready to be grilled, how do you proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterised by just a few drops in preparation of the dishes.
The same goes for the barbecue.
Some of the oils are complete taboos for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before the barbecue, rub the oil, stop eating your food.
The preparation of the annexes is also an essential part of the barbecue.
Practically anything - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad, and many more are useful for grilled meat and fish.
Chef from Bohemia Oilers recommend a salad of the Hot Summer, for example.
For him you need: • 1 ks of peaches • 1 volume of rucks • 1 cup of sliced cucumber • 1 cup of a mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons grape oil
Into the salad bowl, add to the mixture of salad leaves of shredded rucola, sliced cucumbers and to large cubes sliced peaches.
According to the flavour of the salt and pepper, you can also get a mousse of chilli and soy sauce.
At the end, pocket a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: Not only drugs, but also on the will of the patient.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs a range of experts: Neurologist, physiotherapist, ergoterapeut, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist, and many other specialists.
However, this is not only about treatment, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations if they choose to have a child, including social-welfare advice, recommendations on housing, etc.
Yet all of this is not enough: The development of the disease can fundamentally affect the patient itself.
The more he actively struggles with the disease, the longer he can work and may not fundamentally change the style of his life.
As doctors warn, the passivity of the sick releases room for disease activity.
For example, it has been shown that the regular movement has significantly delayed the time when the sick needs some compensatory aid, such as a cane.
Importantly, patients and their surroundings are not subject to different myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a trolley.
This is why the site has been given a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of sick with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, there is twice the saying that what the disease starts to treat sooner, the doctor may have something to do with it.
This is because we have medicines for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and delay the disability, explains Dr. Eva Medina from the Neurological Clinic of the General Hospital in Prague.
She is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often addresses the weakening of lower extremities or disturbances of the balance.
With the sick, they work according to their individual needs: To maintain the condition, improve the walk, increase pelvic floor, reduce swallowing disorders, or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the particular difficulty of the patient," says Dr. Martin Kövári, a Mayor of Clinic rehabilitation and body medicine at the University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis are suffering from the same disease, but they are shown in a different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always mitigate its symptoms.
But movement activity also strengthens the body's immune state, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
The other positives of regular exercise are the fact that the sick check out what they can do, and that reinforces their confidence.
"The exercise is also washed out by endorphins and you feel good about it," Dr. Kamila lashes out from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the University Hospital of the Royal Vinohrady.
By influencing the physical side, we operate on the limbic system responsible for emotion.
We are directly intervening in the psyche and immune processes, and we stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called saving, today we know they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr Paul Kolar, a senior Clinic of rehabilitation and body medicine at the University Hospital in Motole.
The goal of physiotherapy is to allow one to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including a job assignment.
As a result, physiotherapists cooperate with ergoterapeutics so that each person has a compensatory device tailored to him for peace.
Many patients also need care for a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a tough situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shaken up.
They are experiencing shock, panic, fear.
They have to respond to the big burden - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we're supposed to go after someone, not try to get carried away on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to ultimately conclude that even with a handicap, it can live a fully-fledged life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malin-Schubert of the Neurological Clinic General Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague producer Latecoere, the Airbus would not fly.
Air production is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
The new planes are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that can't be made and processed immediately.
Yet, in addition to the super-accurate, computer-driven machine tools, alongside autoclaves for composite composites, they encounter something as common as apricots pecans.
In a drum that resembles a pot of cotton candy, in a pile of pegs, the edges of the tin parts have just come out of the milling machine.
"No one better yet," smiles Ivan Dubsky, director general of the airline's Latecoere Czech Republic.
A full door for Airbus A320 is produced in the area in the Prague Letteries.
As the only ones in the world, they are supplying the door for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, the part of which is assembled in Prague, also enters the first and upper classes on the upper decks of the world's largest transport aircraft, the Airbus A380.
There's also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
Perhaps the moment keys leaves the company to adjust twice a year.
Should the yellow label miss the inspection record, they should have to explain to auditors from Airbus or Boeing in Prague, who travel regularly to see if the door is produced according to the agreed rules.
But the human senses have not yet fully recovered the advanced technique.
There are 1,500 rivets on one of the doors to the A320.
You have to manually break the rivets.
It takes two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer, they'll know if the ripper is properly cracked.
The tolerance in which they are moving is minimal.
The rivets can rise from zero to 0.13 millimeters above the plane's surface.
That's roughly double the thickness of the human hair.
In control, he will come to a number of trained hinterland.
When the controller runs his finger along a line of rivets, he'll know if any of them are out of tolerance.
Then he'll take the exact conditioner to the hand.
Letov had a program of an L-39 trained military aircraft prior to 1989.
But in 1991, neither did one.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
It was then put together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a selection process for an emergency door supplier for the A321.
The courtship with Boeing was not that happy.
"We were a small firm for them at the time, which didn't have enough money for investment and for Boeing to guarantee long-term stable deliveries," Dubsky recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain closed if Letov did not attend the French group Latecoere's Prague international association in 1999.
I was talking about our co-operation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations were underway with the French, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere had bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new contracts.
In 2000, the assembly of parts of the door for the A320 was started.
Three years later, the doors of the upper deck for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for processing composites for deliveries for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to get to these great contracts.
Maybe we would do parts or small parts.
Partners want to guarantee supplies for twenty or thirty years, Dubský explains.
Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over $2.9 billion and profits after tax of $147 million.
Exclusive status among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested £1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have certificates of quality, certification of 170 specific production processes and qualifications for key staff.
Without them, the company would not make any door to the aircraft.
Obtaining certificates that production processes conform to customers "demands, and in repeated checks, keep them on hold according to Dubai millions of kronor.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and stricter.
We have to train staff, retrofit the facilities and re-certify the process, adds Dubský.
Now the company is completing the preparation of a process for coating zinc and nickel to replace the past for human health harmful cadmium.
They received the award from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
Boeing people arrive, check the concept of the whole line.
Then we show them the production.
They'll check our lab.
One set of samples will test themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, closing the Dubai way that the customers control them.
The reward is the Prague firm's long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague race today, the production of the Reds is falling.
For the A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for a Brazilian or European producer.
But it does not mean that he could tell any price at the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It shows how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, hundred-made pieces.
The price is still falling to some limited value.
We must enter this price pattern.
If not, we will lose, says Dubsky.
Half the hall, where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are complete, is yet empty.
But he is the symbol of the future.
Behind the apron, there is a new semi-robotic line on riveting and fitting the door for an upgraded model of A320 Neo.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
"That's the trend that assembly in aviation is going to take," adds Dubský.
The future line is secure.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Just a few metres away, there will be a line for the complete assembly of doors for the top deck of the A380.
It's a strategic decision by our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production time and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubai.
But before that, the company must pass a qualification test for the assembly of some electrical and electronic devices to the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on further development of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the US Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company, when it can process even composites in addition to metal materials," Dubský says proudly.
However, Latecoere is at the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
In the area of Letov, where he is based, there is no next place.
Before joining the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800, and within three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are forecasting how many hundreds of new aircraft the airlines are ordering each year, they may not be worried about the job.
Although it has contracts for several years ahead, it has faced the parent company of the Prague Latecoere threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to communicate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans traded them for shares.
The lenders have gained 37.4 per cent in the company by increasing the capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or €180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company wrote a new stock of €222.9 million among the existing shareholders.
In total, it raised the capital of €280 million.
In doing so, the whole group is benefiting from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, who are involved in sales of 85 per cent.
Average growth in contracts is expected to rise by four per cent a year until 2017.
In a contract book, it has orders for 2.6 billion euros, equivalent to four-year production.
French media claim that Latecoere is finally able to breathe again after years on the drip.
The Czech Republic race in Prague Airlines is significant for the groups.
The group's sales contribute 16 per cent.
According to the number of employees, the group's largest foreign affiliate.
MPs supported a greater share of the state from the levy on coal.
The change in fees for mining operations is to bring to the Treasury about $427 million more than in 2013.
The government's revenue budgets are to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, commuters received from fees of about $450 million and a state budget of $150 million.
From the extraction of brown coal, there were around 200 million kronor and a state of 66 million kronor.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the amount of recovery in excess of CZK 1,000 per hectare per hectare per year.
The income from these remittances remains in its entirety.
Industry Minister John Mousdek (ČSSD) told MPs that commuters would gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million kronor.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but it is set by the government by its regulation.
The payment shall be recalculated as a product of the amount of the mineral extracted and the rates for the different types of mineral.
According to the Government, the reason for the change is that of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, MEP Mark Benda warned that the pricing of the levy by the government does not need to be in line with the constitution.
But, according to Secretary of Youth, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging a nerve that is state-owned.
The fees are received only by municipalities whose territories are affected.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, there will be three-quarters of the community's money and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive rock extraction.
Part of the money that the state will collect on mining fees will be assigned.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide a year-long rescue service.
The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would hurt communities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kucera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the community as yet, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It's not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to make the Minister of Finance improve the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
Prior to the increase in unemployment at Mosteck, Mrs KSČM warned Hana Aulicka.
Kádner and Aulicky have failed to dismiss the amendment, and he wanted the law to return the government to finishing.
In the explanatory memorandum, it says that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees is not reflected in coal prices, because prices are from more than 90 per cent in the long term.
Thus, major consumers like power plants or theaters should not feel price growth.
"On the other hand, this really increases the risk that the mining organisations will offset the increase in reimbursement by trying to reduce their operating costs, which in particular would reduce the number of employees," the government admits.
However, the increase in fees in terms of employment is manageable.
According to the rapporteur, the amendment to Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial that MPs have yet to know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.
If coal is also benefiting from the limits, then it will have implications for yields for both the state and the community, he pointed out.
Urban disagrees with the youngster in that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fail until after 2020.
The limits on CSA below should be broken for reasons of social, economic, and, because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve poised to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would stay idle for some time and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because it has been sitting down the years since the Fed lowered its rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the major central bank could be able to get out of the zero-dollar and start the process of normalizing interest rates, "says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has done relatively well, there has been a recovery in the form of adding a trillion dollars to a government account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared to increase, but the circumstances suggest they also see big chances against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20: 00 a.m.
Shooter at State University Delta left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later the same day and his colleague - wrote a note in which he claims he was "sorry" for the first murder and that he wished he could take it back, government officials revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gautiere in Mississippi said Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at the State University of Delta, called the police on Monday morning about ten o'clock
And he said he shot someone.
The Lamb dispatcher asked him to send a policeman to his home.
He said: 'I shot my wife last night' and also mentioned that there was a "lovely dog" in the house that "won't bother anyone," but he's upset.
Police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why it was shooting in the house.
When police arrived at the scene, she found the body of 4-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamba, in which it said: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person she ever loved me. "
After leaving the note, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to the University of Delta, where he killed teacher history Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The dean of the university, William LaForge, said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's announcement that Lamb allegedly believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prentiss, Schmidt's government offices said there was "no evidence" of the "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, said she was "a great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steena and Prentiss was "shaken" by the whole case.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linklater Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as the Sun Herald reported, has been working with Prentiss from the home over the internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he was "not going to jail."
When officers caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school's website, Lamb acquired a doctorate in education at the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
The stars who have lost their magic
The actor (left), on a snapshot with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
He struggled with leukaemia in 2001 and lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
The actor also had a drug problem and was detained for possession of drugs in 2008.
All these things surely take their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be a few months out of the game due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Lize Championship against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-footer has left this injury in tears and put him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless save by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw pushed into the PSV area.
Nine minutes he was being treated in the playground and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double fracture of his leg and is now in hospital."
He will be taken tomorrow or possibly the day after and then continued to operate in Manchester.
It's horrible - the kid who comes to Manchester in 18 years has it very hard but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
He was also wearing an oxygen mask when he was in the dressing room.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture of his leg will take six months to heal and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he will still play this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to get a red card and a batting kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalma and a red card.
It was a very nasty surgery with both legs.
A tweet from the account of Shaw says: "Thank you all for their news, the words cannot be expressed as I destroyed, my path to recovery starts now and I will come back even stronger."

The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip coca, the PSV coach, said: "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player walks off the field with such injuries, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the anti-players.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in the game for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because his intention wasn't to hurt the anti-player, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," he said coca.
I wasn't able to spot this moment.
I only saw the ball heading in a different direction, so it looked like it [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the surgery on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
The PSV leader Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after the procedure by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: When a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long to learn it almost memory.
You must not be David Cameron.
On the inquiry of children's schemes to appoint a favourite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax, a byte since Dr Seuss, was chosen from 1971.
It was hard to pick, writes Cameron in a report published on SuperCamps website and continues: "Funny, pathetic, creative and with strong content, I liked to read such to my children because there was always an image or message that I hadn't seen before."
All right, after that, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the plot of the book by an elevator from the 2012 film that added more characters and details to fill out a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see the real tree," is the brief content of a book that records the object of love unknown to Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As though it wasn't suspicious enough, the text delivered by Cameron reads like a summary lift of the Lorax film, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words, "In the city of Thneed-Ville walled-in, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy called Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl of your dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not have met the children of the book, where the unnamed young man would know the local nature of the devastation, the trees felled by industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titular Lorax, a crouching, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, the relatively minor PR task was given to an assistant who had never read Lorax's child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from the office of supporters of Cameron.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was at risk of the omission of England but still holding
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England chose on this tour, it will be a repeat of the defeat of the 3-0 that she suffered last time in the Test series, not very likely.
I wouldn't rule out winning guests either.
The side of Alastair Cooper may be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good players sleeping in this batting line-up and also the collective thinking is strong; they don't bear the scars of 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali emerging spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is unknown at the Test series, represent an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in the try series and was replaced by Alex Hale.
The decision to dismiss Adam Lyth is a tough one for me to analyse because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root there were no question marks, which led to the announcement because - and I've put this before - the players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centuries, and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England's chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not entirely 100 per cent, and I am not surprised by that; he was always a team player.
The question of how much Test time will get the batsman to show up is a tough nut.
Lyth got seven caps - as did Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing that you could gripe about is that England gave first chance to Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - although he was Lyth in the best form - but this wasted opportunity is past.
Here comes Alex Hales and that's the batsman I value very positively.
It's the x-factor cricket player we've seen here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he won the 236 on Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity given by his predecessors, but this will depend, of course, on the general assembly in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts alongside Cook, who would gain another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been gifted and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why the strokeaker can't launch and this left-handed man has already shown he's an amazing player of cricket.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and the big difference is not.
My former team-mate Justin Langer played first of his first 38 exams before his appearance in 2001.
Three centuries went by, and he didn't look back.
The team comes by Zafar Ansari as a backup spinner and when I had the chance to watch him, he took me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at its gross statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and I see it as a pram, but there aren't a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and selectors opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
Outside the team, England seem to have made some changes and a clever addition to their coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the most beautiful playing men who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of a tour of the white-ball and will bring in a team of both energy and ruthless spark.
I have always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and as much as Mahela possesses the intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, though it's the voices of saying consistent things that have been dealt with before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Collingwood's teammate Ben Stokes was given a one-day leave, just as Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.
Even if many disagree, coaches and selectors do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
A Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-conceived strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into other problems with every passing day even without the election of a brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corby to the head of the Labor Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat has recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of them because of them - some member states already have enough of the British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions, and disruptive changes to the treaty, which they mostly did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want it even if they had denounced social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a picture before a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be inundated by Britain in European Europe - "We don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggesting that some shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as has been the case for too long a continued Thatchera (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's difficult to see how to break my legs in helping the Selfie Britons who might be able to invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately unhelpful remarks of the SNP's style during the campaign ahead of the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to expedite the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing worthwhile from negotiation."
Europeans, to their own detriment, know how ferocious Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical about the EU are the press oligarchs, because they were not inspired by Tony Ben in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973, in a 2-1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, the Saudi-backed Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels-based correspondent of "EU Rovers" at the start of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of villains of unpaid taxes, foreigners hacking phones and the pseudo non-overseas departures that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you were in a cage with a white gorilla, you had to throw bananas at her so she wouldn't put you to dinner, and then also tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, by opposing Cameron's refereeing routine, since Blair admitted the principle of the repeal of the EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005, and won the card bouncy.
The press never forgave him.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he should not be wasting my time on me - it seems to be in danger of a renewed strategy of boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy of engaging media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday has left.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I'll say nicely, evolves.
He argues that he would like to remain in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people out of the frenzied tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept that.
The same said Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout could not be committed to admitting that Corby's appointment of abrazing McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty, without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Ben's phrase - it seems not to have been what McDonnell said, even what JC had told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he also touched me - the discipline of the report remains important in the ages of TV transmission, and especially in the faith, the painstaking paranoia and betrayal that social media is
It's fair not to provide Cameron's free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to regard the support of the Labor Party in the referendum campaign for the obvious, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnello and Corby's basic rudeness about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences in the central nature of dogmatic bickering.
As with his crackdown on Nato - Tom Watson is confident that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand the meaning of it all for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of the concession of Britain when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed in the brisket "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of the Conservative government in power, as I was reminded of Monday's launch of what was called the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise review of electronic published by Public Health England
A statement by the government-funded agency about being e-cigarettes about 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people from whom some have links with the tobacco industry, the researchers report.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet criticism of the evidence used in its report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published a "landmark" report last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the breadth of the data and have drawn attention to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The editorial in the tech journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely shaky base" on which PHE based its main findings.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ have questioned claims that were reportedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The underlying principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They indicate that the public could expect a PHE statement that reads "the current best guess is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to draw up the analysis of the multi-criterion (MCDA) decision to synthesize their views on the damage associated with the different products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had reportedly already received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the mandate of public health BAT in the sustainability report, it says.
One in 12 participants admitted funding from the manufacturer of e-cigarettes, but not the funding allegedly obtained earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for selecting members of the panel is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of e-cigarettes, some of whom also claim industrial funding in the paper.
Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
A meeting in PHE also took part in the tobacco leadership.
The report created in this group "eloquently admits," the lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products to most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had already been answered before.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One of two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and also what they don't show, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
A clear highlight of the current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not without risks, bear only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should quit with EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4
The former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcast programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give the right hand" for a hit show such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programs not made by other British television broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programs likely to be watched by only a handful of people, into complex broadcasting times over its rivals "biggest ratings show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After Generally Director Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully tried to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC backs up and sends out programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without the state's contributions," Johnson said in the Communications Commission in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the BBC's future.
If you retain the royalties I am not sure about whether they are a good idea in the medium or long term, the production should be reduced at least in terms of programmes that do not produce or exclude others.
They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcasting time because they want to get the widest possible support into the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and of course meaningless.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why the regressive tax should support programs that can be funded by no-contributor.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders next, and understandably produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for them.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, an entrepreneur in the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC he felt vindicated by gaining ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the BBC's most popular show repeats those former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his Mactaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest the BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said even the more pampered public service programs of the BBC "go to BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they fulfill their authority and can argue as they prepare for their hypocritical mission to justify a £4bn income from royalties," But, of course, we do all these obscure programs that no one is looking at. "
They broadcast them at a time when no one is looking at them.
As for the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call on you to find a regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people, for whom £150 is a lot, I would be surprised if they pay so much, because they don't look at the BBC so much.
The former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who stepped down before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its reigning mission in terms of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production has now been classified as educational - it used to be 1% television production and 0.1% on radio - and should take on a pattern of public public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, which only a handful were sent off on television, and to connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses influence the direction the patrols are moving.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny patrols change direction by the time they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity by light
The scientists said these worms are a great demonstration of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, said for the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are implanted in the brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Polishes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves that then pass through the body of worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves operate in the ion channel TRP-4, which is located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels are opening up and activating the cells they are associated with, the report says in the journal Nature Communications.
To control the tubers using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion channels of TRP-4.
When then used on such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and carried to worms, where modified motor neurons were switched on.
The new method is akin to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and switch neurons through the light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike the light, which must be sprinkled with optical fibre to the required site in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.

Adverts of the disgraced British trade in arms.
Watch the video on the anti-weapons market from Amnesty International.
Formidable killer drones!
Shackles to the feet that breaks my ankles!
Three-seater missiles!
And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no one in doubt that this advertisement for the world's biggest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the willingness of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes across defence and security facilities International cheerleaders in the Excel Centre in the London borough of Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with emerging posters on bus stops and metres that require a second look.
"An important announcement, Travelling on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" Reads one, using a font with the London Underground with DLR lines becoming the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms deal.
The 300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismalands.
A collection called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute throughout London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs," which is £6 for a piece of Allen's key, which reportedly "will gain access to around a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flypostings "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies made by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a specialist assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in the protest movement and realise they have to get out in the real world to make their art impact on society.

Video Amnesty was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by a VCCP working without a fee and a graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of VCCP, Matt Lever, would be surprised by the silence surrounding the advertising of arms trade - he saw an empty seat in the Excel calendar - and he thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the creation of a more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "by adding colourful colors and animations, I have achieved that it will attract more people."
"They've done a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take measures and ensure that it does not deal with torture equipment illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside the Excel, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US military on "on the arm of launcher AT4CS RS."
That includes a "uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight gold rules for life on student college
11 years ago, I moved on to student tracks as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still a believer in bereavement and moral relativism, but until now I recall the tense smiles of those I wilted - and numerous, lengthy complaints on the other.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving onto the rails can range from slightly to nerves passing through to totally appalling.
It's tempting to babble: To tell people where you're from, if you took a year of break, what's your opinion on Corbyn and why "you honestly don't really love Marmite because, people, it's just an extract of yeast hahaha, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to also take a breath - ask and show interest.
It's directing the conversation and helping you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn't even talk to if your eyelashes were in one fire, and they would put out the fire extinguishers.
Leave the people alone.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking receptions, places of film evenings and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college and being in a relationship
Introverts on high will come in short.
Your room should be a sanctuary, yet a lot of the tracks change to an off-campus walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
That can be hell for someone who needs to pick up.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialising - and maybe write him a place of knock.
Speaking of knocking: Knock.
One boy in my tracks had a habit that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Because you started going to university at the top of a peaking mania, a knock on a stranger's door and a show with a slice of baked cakes seems slightly less weird, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've made you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering domestic delicacies is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you and maybe everything will end up adding your face to a tasty surprise.
That, of course, is the object of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and fat are likely to guarantee that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock them on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime on student college.
Stealing the whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk into your tea theft?
Double check with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that the milk will be offered to you even if they are whittled inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who has replaced her milk for washing dishes to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't be making noises that disturb people from sleep or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also responsible people in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbours if they could turn down the drum and bass, because they were 3 at night and had a written in the morning.
Their response was the amplification of music.
When they finally shut down at 5: 00 in the morning, she'd let them sleep for two hours and then let go of her own music, locked the door, and left for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same dorm as you?
And on the contrary, it wouldn't be terribly embarrassing if you mistook your roommate for your future husband, sleep together, break up, and have to see each other every day and maybe take control of your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you don't want to break your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to have a little talk with your weaknesses.
In a buoyant moment when you realise that someone left the keys in your unlocked room, there's only a thin line between funny and bullish.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and entertaining lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroying someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and give them the keys to the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never put their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects of the future.
Eva has endured a cruel moment in her pregnancy with the seven-year-old.
His daddy broke up with her and on the preparation and education of the child was alone.
With the situation I settled quite quickly - I was looking forward to the baby and looking at the positives.
The uncertainty and the fact that I was going to be alone with the baby, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had a chance in myself that we wouldn't stay alone for a long time, recalls Eva today for her first pregnancy.
She'd already met on the internet in the old Vasek chat room, and they started talking about their favorite movies.
Vasek Eve with More has even imported home from the hospital, but he has not played too much into the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva said in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The theme of the third series of Czech television is the search for happiness at the second attempt.
The care of the Visa and the financial security of the family has been handled through part-time work and great help for both the mother and the help of the aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child ultimately did not spoil your affection for Eve.
They finally got together around Victor's second birthday, and he now understands Vasek as his dad and he also calls him that.
Although Vasek already has two grown-up daughters, fatherhood at 60 is enjoying his words, and children are also more devoted to them.
In addition to the Welcome to them, there were still two-year-old Leonkies and, finally, the twins.
"Vasek has floated so naturally in our family, perhaps even by the fact that my mother has never spoken to me in relationships," the smiling Eva thinks.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
Twins Ema and Ela were born to the Caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are then present in the excessive amounts in the blood of the pregnant and are shown in particular.
The disease is dangerous to unborn fetuses, who are at risk of premature birth and death, with mothers after childbirth mostly spontaneous.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eva and your happiness, although they were only in the 36th of the week.
Emilie was placed in an incubator in the intermediation ward, where she also works for your niece, who was able to take over and accommodate her.
Eline was larger and, after being transported from the ICU to the room, I had it on me, describing the difficult times after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until doctors had vowed to release the babies, who, meanwhile, managed to reach the border of two khal.
But the wait for bringing in the children of Eve was not a pleasure.
"I was mad with a stitch after my husband and children," he recalls a difficult moment on the department's six-year-old mother.
She was also thinking of her husband and the signing of the reversion, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But it did not happen in the end, and doctors dismissed Eva and the twins into home care.
The story of four pregnancies and births sends the QT1 on Tuesday night at 21: 45 a.m.
A large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eve had to do with an electric double-fence and cramped conditions.
The dollhouse did not increase, but Vasek made Eva's joy by installing a gas cooker to make meals for six people more comfortable.
If he's the best, we'll be shooting a cab.
Eva is convinced that children, in particular, perceive the family's wellbeing and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or the homage of the cottage.
For now, we have sat down very nicely, better than we expected.
The clutter is harder to hide in a small space, and the puddling of the babies sometimes crosses, but at least we're all around, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Your work lighting up on the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he occasionally trips to Prague's streets as a taxi driver.
In his sixty years, according to his words, the care of both the family and the children is physically manageable, how long will it be?
"I realise that, given our age difference, I will be the one to feed this family," Eva admits, in questioning the future.
She would like to return to employment, but she is even more attracted by the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly the same for the employer.
And if it's the worst thing, my husband and I can shoot a cab, joke a nice blonde.
Apple has suffered a yes-yes effect.
It's all on display.
A more powerful processor, a bigger resolution camera, a firmer scar, or a display that recognizes the power of touch, that is in short of the virtues of the recently introduced iPhones of the ninth generation.
The two last then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
For now, the trend of the Apprentice has been that every new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly over previous iPhones.
Indeed, the two-gramma mass of the difference to the detriment of the news was negligible.
But this is far from the case for new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, weight grew in a smaller model of 14 grams, larger then 20 grams.
One side cannot be surprised; last year, Apple's pockets were greatly troubled by the blowback in Apple's pockets.
The snacks are so out of the more resistant aluminium alloy 7000, which has also been projected on the mass.
But a much bigger impact on her have displays.
In fact, Apple has used a 3D Touch technology that makes the displays discern the power of touch.
To do so, the display had to be provided with another layer of capacity sensors.
The mass of displays of new iPhones has grown more than twice as opposed to previous generations.
For smaller iPhones from initially 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhones 6s, the display is the hardest-used component.
A weight of just 143 grams is then reached on this news, thanks to the defrosting bark that touched most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then the hardest part of the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way relative to the predecessors.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is noticeable on display.
The weight of 5.5 "iPhones 6s Plus so reaches 192 grams.
How practical the new display technology will be in use.
The first users will be able to test this on Friday 25 September, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Are cereal breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?
In Italy's Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have made a finding that opens up interesting possibilities.
There were traces of the settlement of modern humans from various times, including wall paintings, remnants of tools and so on and so on.
But in a layer of 23A, which, according to the instruments, dates back to about 30,000 years ago, however, scientists have discovered something very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, there were traces of oats in place, which seemed to go through the production process today.
In it, the grains dip first today, then dry, dispose of the packaging, the so-called plush, then save and flatter the flat.
In the cave Paglicci managed to discover the grains that appear to have been heated or saved, and then apparently crushed between the two mill stones - at least that suggests traces of use on two stone in the cave.
Thus, scientists have been unable to demonstrate in their publication for the PNAS magazine that a complete production process would occur in the cave, but the similarity is really striking.
We also have no evidence of how the people flakes could eat, but the assumption that it was with some fluid and possibly warm enough, of course, is offered entirely logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting document of how intensively people have used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.
In fact, if the entry-level interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have passed agriculture by roughly twenty thousand years.
New reporting stations in the Dopram Transformation of the City of Bremen.
So I once again listened to the names of the stop signs in the trolleybus:
Certainly, the trolleybus was a little more noisy, so the message in the man's voice was somewhat less comprehensible than before, when the stops sounded in the woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic, it is better discernible than a deeper male voice.
The DPMB argue that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but I'm sure they picked up from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the noise of the bus engine.
I've lived in Brno for quite a couple of decades, so the right names of all those stops are known to me, so I don't need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere who do not know in Brno, and for whom these reports are primarily determined, can be confused and may at the final, where they mistakenly arrive, then claim that the footage they had to speak was not reported at all.
Perhaps he would have had the choice of the announcer - but better again the announcer - to do it again, and this time under the normal traffic noise and the roar of the engine in which the microphone of the speaker on the bus was almost lost.
So that we do not have to continue to listen to the names of the stations of the Water Hershek, the Whisperer, or then Ponorous in the creaking sage I've crossed in the Chamber.
I suppose my old man's ears hadn't grown so much during the only day that the announcer had changed.
Before that day, I understood the message pretty well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From a tracksuit.
Today, few know what the leaders of the party's biggest and cleverest have been the so-called comprehensive clearances.
I took the liberty of remembering.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office when I heard from the radio that it was just seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't break down with the comrade chief, he came a minute in front of you, and it seems he's not in the mood," the dispatcher observed, while I was writing the pages.
Thanks. I'll be careful.
Tell me I'm going to the precinct for a review of minor mechanization.
It's not gonna work. There's some background checks today.
They're all scared shitless.
What's the point?
"You'll see," the dispatcher sneered.
Next time, you'll be too.
I ran out into the hall.
Then the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Stiff, stony-faced, in a perfectly fit uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, and quickly switched on two buttons of the uniform jacket.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone that the old replied.
"You're playing," said Eva, the elderly lady, who I appreciated very much.
She said she even was a chieftain before the comrades took her down.
They're clearances, and you're coming in.
How many times have I asked what these comprehensive clearances are, but no one really wants to talk about it.
They say they're going to be one in three years, they all have to go to them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
I'll see.
I pulled the file out of the drawer with periodic reports and then the phone.
"Holcman, come to me right now," said the chief's voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing... "I muttered, but no one answered, everyone just with their thoughts.
"Good morning, Comrade Chief, I've come to your order," I said, and I walked into the chief's office.
The chief sat behind his desk and looked at some of the papers.
"Comrade mechanic," he said after a moment, without raising his head, looking carefully at the paper, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the paper down on the table, leaned back in the chair, and stared at me through the usual, unpleasant, prickly look.
I was uneasy.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the Deputy commended that I had worked very well over the few months in office, and that I was very happy with him.
The chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon at the distance.
And now this?
Remember, you're a track-distance technician, and that's what you have to do.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just not acceptable.
I swore I'd use such a greeting since I was a kid, that I was so raised and that I didn't see anything wrong with him.
The chief was like a red rag to the turkey.
"You're on a socialist rail, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," the chief said.
Plus, you're still confusing your superiors.
Once you say "sir," for the second time again, "comrade."
But for you, I'm not Mr. Chief, but Comrade Chief.
The deputies are comrades of the deputy, the top tradesman are comrades of the top line-up!
You must remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a regular citizen salute.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of the job, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the side," the chief said, his voice calm.
But that's what we're talking about.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a pre-paid retirement chair up here.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it did not look good with the concerned.
He impaled me with a cold, prickly look, and I looked for the words to answer.
I was also irritated by his haughtiness.
He was only a few years older, and he was playing God, in fact, a comrade.
Jovial, pompous, authoritarian, arrogant, as it suited him at the moment.
He was all used to it.
He's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, was like all partisans, but also non-partisans, tycoon.
But the chief towered many, especially those who could claim his superiority.
Right now, he was rubbing me in for a complete tie.
I thought something about my ass, and it cost me enough power not to shoot him in the face.
But I would not go back to the Crusaders, let alone continue to make an irritating official.
What would I support two kids from?
And set up a house!
I was crying, but I controlled myself.
I'm not gonna give him pleasure.
"That's all so far, you can go," the audience said, and began to look closely at the papers he had had in his hand.
At 11: 30, they called me.
Everyone in the office was already there and on questions about what and how, they answered, that it was going to be good.
Only Jozhin said softly, as was his habit, that they couldn't throw us all away, because that job would have to do the co-chief himself with his faithful, and that he was not in danger.
The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what the old man had done to me this morning.
There was a nice gathering in the chief's office.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long council table, other comrades who should have made a decision about my clerical being or not being.
A disciplinary committee, chairman of the ROH, a staff writer, a specialist for special purposes, something to do with the military, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the person most important, the chairman of the party organisation.
I knew him.
An ordinary track worker, undercut the slingshot or pitches of gravel.
But also a former bachelorette.
There was a rumor that he was no fun at the time, said a pretty beast.
Bad languages claimed that he had been out of school in the seventh grade, learned nothing, learned nothing.
And when the criminal was cancelled, he ended up on the spindle at the picks.
But comrade, yes, the comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unenviable dart in my throat.
The cadaver read a report from the civil committee from the residence.
I come from a working family, I am married, two children, and so on and so forth.
So far, so good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then a report from the aisle organization.
He copped a report from the civil committee, perhaps both of them were written by the same man.
But then it came!
The parents of long-time members of the party, refused to appear before the screening committee and then withdrew from the party, reportedly for medical reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadaver noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief nodded.
It was only worse.
I was a member of the city's SSM committee and there I was recruited for the party's nominee.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and the wedding, apart from the national committee, was also in church.
I have disappointed the party's confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was cut out of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had the two children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I went to a church funeral, though it was a former member of the party.
All of this gives me a negative attitude to the party's leadership.
When the cart was finished, only the tapping of the chief's pencil in the desk was punctuated by a tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
In doing so, I kept thinking to myself, "Komunists - superhumans, communists - superpeople." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay at the smiths?
I could repair the switches without any of the fucking clearances.
But now?
The career of an irritating official took hold of her before she began.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think so. I'm sure the chief will be out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you investigate this comrade?"
Well, according to the report from the previous job.
Do you have it here?
The corsage was obviously not twice.
There was a sweat on the glass, nervously blinking, as if he had been checked himself.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"Oh," said the chief with a hint of granite, but often foreshadowed by thunderstorms.
At first sight, he had been praising, teaching with honors, studying an industrialist, working in a piecemeal as a locksmith, the norm filling an average of a hundred and twenty percent.
But that's what's missing.
Where did you get that report, comrade? "He said, turning back to the cadaver, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him, and that he might not have had to be a cadaver very soon.
This is the comrade who gave it to me.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he got to us, he went to the precinct," he said.
And there wasn't any sign of him, he was kind of an extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were assigned to the technical function, this piece of paper was enough," the chief said dryly.
The cadaver blinked nervously, and there was no reply.
"Never mind, we'll discuss that later," the matter of the chief, apparently relieved.
For the time being.
"What's the matter with you, Comrade?" The chief returned to me.
All of a sudden, it's over!
My eyes were flooded, I felt hot.
There was a torrent of remorse and accusations, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world who deserved no mercy.
By subjecting the incomplete report, I said, in the mistake of a comrade's referendum, I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I received it from a cadaver in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of building real socialism, supports reigning religious, or even participating.
That there was a lot of things I had done, or maybe I was still going to sleep, and I was praying that it would be over.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care that I was going to get out of the mechanic's place.
I didn't care that they would take my picks.
This is work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," said the Party Chairman, interrupting the chief's levity.
Here the comrade made a mistake, a tremendous mistake.
What a mistake, he did the wrong thing!
But he already has his punishment!
Don't you forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to put his door on the side for time!
To open it again, he will have to prove that he has changed to be worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated bachelorette sounded like a book.
Where did that come from?
Is he so literate or parakeable phrases from stealth training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must be given a chance!
A chance to prove he had changed.
And who should give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, to support his efforts to repair it!
It's your party duty that no one will entertain you!
In fact, it's a party obligation for all of us, too.
Here the comrade must see that the side has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but that she also loves.
When the President was finished, no one looked up.
No one expected such a turnaround.
At least me.
"I agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief said coldly, trying to take the initiative again.
If you had let me finish, you would have heard that I was heading for that conclusion.
Everyone nodded their heads in agreement, but they could see that he didn't believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate reference to the basic means," I said, when I returned to my office, and then I began to cry.
Still, in addition to Engineer Evy, everyone was at lunch.
She listened silently to my rambling scenes of fresh experiences, and I, meanwhile, calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I could have a coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she set the water on the stove and set up the cups.
In the meantime, she was talking about disciplinary practices.
As one report, often full of praise, puts a man in your hand, and the other in which there is dirt, they send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to be, but on the top of the picks, and so comrades in the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our fellowship?
He was just old enough to eat or drink, and that's how it turned out.
"He'll get it from the old one," she said maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Keep an eye on him, he's massively.
And the party chairman?
In fact, a far worse chief, no lidumiles.
Zero from the picks that have big power.
The coffee began to boil, and then the office filled with the scent of coffee.
I dropped a cube of sugar into the cup and stirred the hot potion in silence.
I hope I'm the worst out there.
Now they don't throw me out, and there aren't any more clearances in three years.
Anyway, the Comrade Chief just won't forget today.
It came up in the anthology of the literature on TRATI II in the book.
The symbol of the village has been revived.
The round of the windmill over Chlum is spinning again after years.
You can see it by far, because it's located at a fifteen-foot-high mast.
People from the wide area call him the "fan of Chlum."
For the municipality, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the general emblem that the municipality gained to the occasion of the resurgence of the year in 2010.
"We asked for a sign then, and the fan, of course, wanted to have one, he knows him around everyone," said the mayor, George Masek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the moment: It is reminiscent of a time when people here have fought for good drinking water.
The one in Chlum in past centuries was a rarity.
In 1910, they decided to boast contenders for a solution that then suited up to the mid-1980s.
In the village, they left a deep well in the village.
Three years later, the well was accompanied by a still-metallic structure with a wind pump that pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the church.
"The building was carried out by Antonin Kunc of the Hranic on Moray's cargo of 2,400 kronor," says a commemorative sign on the ground fence of the construction of the mast.
The pump after several repairs and the winds of the wind farm served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of fighting began to start.
The wind pump has only been left with a non-functional general symbol and the local rarity.
The Dominant got operational at this year's hometown reunion.
When in 2008, the Chlummies decided to fix the wind round and bring it back on track.
They left a replica of the original round - reduced to an average of half a metre.
The wheel was confined to the mast, but it must have been taken down that same year.
The replica producer did not select suitable material and the wheel could not withstand wind gusts.
Then the Chlummie Dominant had been resting under the roof for several years.
From June this year, however, the round on the high mast is spinning again.
For the occasion of the reunion, the village ordered the replica of the wheel to adjust and set it back to the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws utility water from the well just into a rapper's blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely unplugged him because there was little water in the well.
At least it was empty.
"In the autumn, the heat of the windmill from the pump will be removed from the pump in the suction basket again," Mayor Masek explained.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where it has put the wind round in the general emblem, but is the only one of this kind across the Highlands.
A similar feature in the character is in honour of the local technical sights, for example, in Chvalkovic and Green Mountain on Vyskaya, in Kuželov on Hodonin, Partutovice, or in Polici on Vsetínsk.
No hard feelings, but I don't know Lafont, she admitted to support Tripoli Goian.
"The game against Slavia I remember very well, even my goal, as all in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
We were trained by Georghe hagi then, it was too bad we lost.
I hope to score a goal with Sparta now.
Just the difference that we're not going to lose this time, "Goian continued.
This man, who has played 60 games for Romanian representation, is a key supporter of the Greek team.
As a stalwart he will face the raiders of the Spartan offensive.
There will be a few thousand people, no hell, he says of the Greek duel spartan Hybsh.
And he partly suspects what he can expect on Thursday night.
I am well known to Fataie, who played in Romanian Astor with my brother Luciano.
I've seen all their matches at the time.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he also went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not name another soccer player in the Prague Club, and so came the direct question of whether he also knew David Lafont, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and the captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and, with a slightly reproachful look, directed at the Czech journalist.
"Why do you ask me that?"
After a moment's silence, he dropped it.
We saw some videos, and I noticed that Sparta was playing a lot of teammates.
He has really good players.
And Lafont?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else except Fatah.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has the experience of bigger clubs, you can say that he holds the defence of Asteras, it's such their organiser of the game," Spartans assistant Stanislav Hejkal observed.
Goian already has the best years behind him, but he can boast a very interesting football biography.
His time was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester units United and City, from Steauy but headed to Italy's Palermo, also playing for the Glasgow Rangers.
We're expecting an aggressive and unusual style, the coach says.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European leaders, pitting for victory in the Czech league.
For me, there's a favourite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to launch the group with good results.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in the room with the Slovakian goalkeeper, Tomas Košice, who is very pleased with his opponent in the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering joining the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to trading in the company's shares in the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are largely legal and administrative and do not have a de facto impact on events in society, says Daniel Burysh, finance director of the Kofola group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering the location of the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Burzu Securities Exchange, the Company is completing a prospectus of security, which will be submitted by the Czech National Bank to approval at the earliest.
The transfer of the holdings and the related transfers of shares will be made in the form of non-public transactions involving only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no shares will be offered to the public or to the new investors in the framework of this operation.
"Any offer of shares to the new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders decide - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has said in the past that a possible supply of shares could be made up of issuance of new shares or sales of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a stock offering in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of the stock and the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
A test of the objectivity of Czech television in informing the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of coverage of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time, the broadcast of the main news session of Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they teach journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcast of the Czech Television Events.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the broadcast of the news.
For the first minute, when TIME reported the unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border, and the attacks of migrants on the police, she called the euphemistically out of patience - throwing stones and attacking metal rods, the current profligate propaganda - judging by the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - large scope for non-profit organizations that criticize poor treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - the story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but as a chance.
Wandering the refugees - TIME has consistently used the expressions of a runner or a refugee and not a migrant.
Crucially, it is mainly that the T in the illustration has been used consistently just and only snapshots on small children and women.
Meanwhile, alone in the same broadcast, she said that there were 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic.
Summary: Of the greater part of propaganda that has no precedent from communist agitators.
I must say, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once recovered to the doll's apartment, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
I had fish in the makeshift toilet.
The fishes of the home, an insect with a change of imperfect, that is, not making the transition from a caterpillar to a beetle, and the cub looks like an adult, only tiny and gradually increasing.
They were disgusting and I hated them.
First hand and later chemically.
The socialist drugmaker at their disposal provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it was done successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in the same way.
A box with a kind of juvenile anesthesiologist who carried the ants into the nest, and then he would not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, insects became the subject of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from life that interfering in the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
The truth with fleas and bugs, I don't think I'd get to exacerbate the karma of killing them.
In the new home, my partner and I agreed that if they weren't going to be able to crawl up our necks, they would eat the flakes of decayed skin, some of those invisible eyelashes, and the like.
Their peaceful existence was broken by a spider.
It was a common kind of trick that resided in the ceiling for a long time.
We were supposed to live from the occasional mucus and mosquitoes, which only heightened comfort.
Because he had lived with us for several years, we discovered that they were mainly fed, and that their numbers seemed to maintain their numbers.
A confidential regular contact with each carried out we found that it was a female.
In fact, we were seeing romantic talk with a partner about a third of the smaller, as carefully tinted on the strands of the web, so that it would not be eaten before it reached the desired excavation.
It took about three days that they did not move and did not respond to our checks.
Beneath the toilet bowl, where the love games were taking place, we found the remains of a dried-up male next to the female.
Then the spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging from her surroundings.
They soon disappeared.
They were eaten away by their mother, and they ran away.
Even the female has gone missing after a week.
If she went away or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
Right, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that great-looking toilet.
For some time from the ceiling, she watched our behavior carefully, and moved under the toilet bowl to assess our aggression as a friendship.
The numbers of somewhat-hyped fish were reduced again, and the spider slowly looked at its normal activities to provide food.
All year, our ecosystem hasn't changed.
Our daughter among this has reached an age where the use of the potter has been a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal healing of its contents has already been given to us.
We picked it up more strongly to use the toilet.
Her daughter, however, had found an excuse in that spider she had seen very well.
Our talk of having a spider seen...... has never taken any happiness in the house.
Crying and screaming, she forced her trouser.
There was no other way.
There was a time when a spider had to be, in the interest of a daughter's development, to command.
It's all down to me.
He was trapped in a glass and banished across the balcony into the garden.
I used to say goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt loathe after such a long experience as if I was throwing a relative.
We assumed that the fish would begin to appear more often and begin to multiply by a geometric series.
Wonder, week, two, we haven't found any.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I wondered if there was a spider in the direction of the ants, somehow, that the bathroom environment was not as conducive to their existence as we thought.
But then the first bits of midsize came, and they were bustling again.
I had to think of another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their link to the spider must have had a cause in that when they couldn't see it, that it was hidden in some other place, and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection to their predator, and his rapid disappearance triggered some sort of alarm.
It's more that I have no illusions about their eyesight.
Some light plaques showed, but that they would react to waving arms or fast movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom on a regular basis.
I think she's forgotten the potty.
All we have to do is attract a spider.
I'm already sending my wishes to the ether, and I hope they haven't turned on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that Cyclone B.
The Ten Commandments of Albert Einstein, which has enriched the world.
The prophets of the genius of the last century may never have been fascinated by mankind.
He was able to immerse himself so deep that the creation was always a stunning finding.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In particular, the awareness of people has entered its special and general theory of relativity, which, so far, is best described by the universe in its gigantic proportions.
It is also impossible to ignore its explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantum electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the desktop itself, and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity, is so complex for many that they prefer to become easy-to-date.
But it is not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, if he could not find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: An hour in the vicinity of your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I allowed myself from his entire pleads of famous quotes to pick up these ten, which literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius is trying not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But one could prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to smash an atom than destroy prejudices.
If the mess is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what will fight in the Third World War, but in that fourth it will be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing too much.
If I had an hour to master the problem my life depended on, I would spend 40 minutes of his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and 5 minutes of his solution.
In the world the hardest thing to understand the income tax.
At the end of the day, I cannot forgive myself for failing to guide Einstein's definition of success: By taking A for success, the formula is: And = X + Y + Z, where X is a work, Y rest, and Z is to keep its mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín region are expecting changes in 1.5 billion.
"It's a success considering that all of this year, all four are held in black numbers," said contender Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of regional facilities is about $32 million at this time.
The stakes in this are mainly higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kron, Visy, Uhersky Hradiště and Zlín, it is due to the building, which together will cost almost £1.5 billion.
The long period when we were shopping mainly devices ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, high-tech health can't be done, the county deputy's plans for health care have been justified.
He enjoys the changes at all hospitals.
The builders will come to the hospitals next year.
In Visy, they now select the supplier of the new internal pavilion for nearly $300 million.
In Krometers, they have a scheduled port of dialysis.
The Oklahoma Hradier wants to open a new intern for around 200 million to this year's open central pavilion.
And the head of Baze's hospital awaits the long-delayed construction of a new central income and an interstate that will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is crucial and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients, and doctors," she said, for example, to the construction of the hospital, the director of the hospital, Vera Proust.
The five-story building is due to be done in about two years and offers comfortable amenities for the intern and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, beds, and intensive care.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are significantly identified by patients will be touched by all regions.
In fact, the new buildings will be replaced by those in which, for example, there are many sufferers on one room, on the floor they have only one toilet, beds are unloaned, the windows are not tight, and the paramedics don't have adequate conditions for the job.
"Our intern, for example, was built thirty-five years ago, and now he's on the edge of his life," the head of the Zola hospital, Pavel Calábek, pointed out.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building linked to an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all emergency departments in one place, in addition to new rooms.
The same model is already half-finished by the Utah Hradier.
The central income is standing by, and there will be an interstate within three years.
"We will pay the building from the loan and in part from our own devices," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding.
Profits are still highest, and there were no losses to the loss two years ago, when a House hospital was struggling with a nearly two-hundred-million-dollar loss.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we will raise revenue and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," listed Patriot Vajas, who has the economy in charge.
Patients chronicled hospitals will also be seen to improve.
Within ten to fifteen years, they will go into repairs, new devices and reconstructions of up to half a billion kronor.
This year, the repair station will be ready, then the port of dialysis, or construction of the building for the new magnetic resonance imaging, will begin.

No one has explained how I should keep the refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
The interior minister, Milan Chovanec (ČSSD), has complained after negotiations with his European colleagues that the other states of the Czech Republic are pushing to adopt quotas for refugee redistribution, but reject any discussion.
He also observes that he has not yet been told how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you, more specifically, describe the position you came to be at the meeting of the EU's foreign ministers and the European Union?
We disagree with mandatory quotas as a system that just can't function.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They're living creatures that have some visions, they're going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we were able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, registration places, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But saying quotas will solve everything?
We've done forty grand a little while ago, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people crossing us want to go to Germany.
There's almost no one for us, we just don't know how to hold them here.
We have the ambition to walk by other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese, and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, they are gaining asylum on us, but the interest of people from this migratory wave, from Syria and other countries, is limited close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don't actually want us, but fifteen hundred people have already pledged to accept.
Would it not be possible to accept more of them?
We have pledged to accept 1500 people, but with the condition.
We said: Functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even with the 1,500, there's going to be 1100 people with whom we can deal with an asylum procedure.
They will come into our detention facility and treat them as much as to those we have captured.
It is a big issue, and we will debate it with Europe if we can hold people to be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe is behaving in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That means, they will come to our territory with the registrations, and if there is a deal that is not yet, it may be that we will not hold that 1100 in the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany after arriving.
If we can restrain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them in an asylum procedure.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent, according to European statistics, receive international protection.
Then they get the papers that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will be relocated.
That's the second project that's been breaking up so far, and we've made progress only by debating the churches about the possibility that they should help them get jobs, accommodation and so on.
But that's a run for a very long line.
You said that at the meeting of ministers with us, the other states were unwilling to discuss.
But is it not that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but offers no solidarity step that would block the debate?
And what exactly does that take to be a solid step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany says an incentive that all migrants from Syria can join them, the message spreads in the hours of all the camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migratory wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want us to.
We think the road is to protect the external borders - just to discourage those migratory waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
To show them that they don't stand a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovans came to Germany last year alone.
From secure Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's office.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, that fifty per cent of what social-welfare systems would spend on them today could go to refugees.
Contrary to the first day that Germany had implemented the controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was 12.
Where should it go to tighten controls on the border?
We were afraid of a glitch in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we're managing.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in stone detentions.
Of course, all the people we hold will return to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones taking these people, with Hungary it's complex and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where is the breaking point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a couple of hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day for two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacity enough to make contingency plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately call an extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in telephone contact a few times a day.
If the situation arises, the government can sit down in force immediately, and by one resolution, it would decide to strengthen the police on the military, say, the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme option is the state of emergency, which has now been declared in some places by Hungary?
I don't think it can come this far.
Keep in mind that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread the alarm.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that Hungarians will attempt to divert migration flows to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then be a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia repaid a lot of debt on the last minute.
They're trying to prevent bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid her debts.
The football players were given their money.
Football Slavia campaigned on Tuesday for the first time for insolvency proceedings before the court.
Nearly three months after that, for about $20 million, she filed a proposal for Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
In a matter of hours, Councillor Senator Michael Wenzil tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzil that he did not have to declare bankruptcy over Slade.
And it must be said she had the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavie became the big Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as Czech billionaire Jiří Shimana.
Obviously from new owners to the club, money has arrived at the last minute.
This also proves a statement by Slavie ahead of Tuesday's court hearing - the drilling club on Monday, just the day before the hearing in the trial, sent owed tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was between September 11 and 15 September," said the legal representative, Slavie Mouser.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovak exrepresentative of Milan Ivan or the Czech bookkeeper Mariu Likud.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club also paid due fees to the city's Prague 10.
As a result, the insolvency proceedings remain de facto only claims that Slavie disputes.
Either according to the club, they have not been formed at all, or are being held by lawsuits.
However, we are prepared to pay for these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can demonstrate by writing from the account," she told the judge's lawyer.
"All that was after maturity is paid," the Met Office said, adding that it would not be paid only to unrelated or disputed commitments.
It is also certain that, in the next few days, the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia for three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid those debts.
In turn, there will be an appreciation of all the evidence.
The decision is therefore to be expected as early as November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the negotiations on the third of November.
But the decision will not fall on that meeting, but in writing after it.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of Inverness welding resources.
The combination of high-tech, hardware and software integrated into modular construction yields benefits and rapid returns on investment in terms of high quality, productivity, and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
And that of any, from welding design steel to welding of special alloys, as well as from welding crude materials to welding thin sheets, from apps in the works to welding in the shipyards.
An incredible amount of welding curves, simple settings and the broadening of the welding source allow it to quickly respond to a change in requirements, leading to a reduction in the prostate, to the need for a realignment of the resources and more productive welding.
FastMig X allows welding top welding processes, developed by Kemppi, which provide higher productivity and the quality of welding.
There is no time to waste, and there is no waste of material or repairing bad wellies.
There is flexibility, there is less leeway, more welding and higher profit.
It's this year's news that premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We are very appreciative of these potions because they confirm the exceptional nature of the product.
World-leading producers may boast similar systems, but, thanks to their differences in software and in the parameters, they include FastMig X at the top of the world.
For the candidates, there are certainly enjoyable delivery times that move around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will certainly be extended after the early trade fair.
We have been with regular participants for over twenty years, and our business results are almost always better than in front of him, emphasizing ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, leading shop manager Kemppi in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blank was built so that she wouldn't break.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanca could also be made safer, says the expert.
The tunnel complex could be built to prevent two drops of earth in the Prague Stadium, the production director of Satra, which is the main projectile of the tunnel, Alexander Butovich.
He said it on Wednesday night in a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion kronor more expensive.
The drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went down safer, but costs are growing exponentially," Butovic said.
The conditions in the Tree were the same for him all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to come from a safer and more careful method.
"If the measure was used 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," said Butovic.
The Blank tunnel collapsed three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, there was a crater in Strom, in 2010, the ground fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrolink George Whitehead, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, the Journal said.
The building was worth £17 billion, according to the original intention.
When we add to it the VAT, which has jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-one-year-olds from seventeen billion.
When it comes to reading the technology, the purchases of land and engineering activity, indexation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which isn't from the 37 again until so far, Whitehead said.
Someone ordered that and paid for it.
Ios 9: How to get a new operating system iPhone with a new Apple update
The new operating system may be requested in Settings when you click the "General" tab and select "Software Update" (software updates).
When ready, it will offer your phone to download and then install it.
Some users teamed up with the problem after the installation, specifically with the error message "software update failed."
One solution to this problem is to wait until the interest in the update or to try it through iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the update process.
And that includes the need to uninstall apps to release the location - but that won't be necessary because Apple's update has diminished and also facilitated the process by using a special tool that will suggest apps to delete and re-install after the update.
Make sure your phone is charged before you release the update.
If the battery status is low, Apple will not allow the start of the update because the interruption of the process could cause an update error.

FedExu's profits mixed, cutting fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in annual profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also said it planned to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In this period last year, FedEx announced that it would be hiring for the holiday of 50,000 seasonal workers.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings of between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates on average of 4.9 per cent, which will take effect in January-4, and higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth over the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
The chairman of the board of directors and CEO Fred Smith said the company "demonstrated a strong performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after the rival UPS company said it plans to hire 90 000 to 95 000 extra workers, which is about as much as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August 31, FedEx received $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted FedEx's results.
In the last quarter, land revenue rose 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit experienced higher income because of higher underlying rates, while profits fell in the cost of trading because of higher prices for labor.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening of FedEx's shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days seated at the 27-foot-long honorean mahogany table, and will decide whether, after nearly a decade, the time has come to raise the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the central bank's ornamentation, the two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Chair Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to give the nation's economic interests above all else.
The central bank has a double charge of Congress: Maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable.
But, since the Great Recession, Fed officials acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: Financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch in weaning off an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since late 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid growth in the economy, the recent turbulence in the world's financial markets could already scare the wary Fed for adding to volatility by raising its benchmark federal funds rate - and no more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch in the first place," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at broker Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the extent, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is already providing them with sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which itself is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
About half of economists recently asked Blomberg to raise rates this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about a 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market in the event that the Fed raises rates only if policymakers make a dent in the promise that the next increase is not in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The rally was run by expectations that the Fed's decision to delay rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raise rates," he says.
If policymakers were to do so, "they would have to go all the way to the extreme in their programming statement, and hold financial markets for them not to panic."
Other experts argued that raising rates would reassure financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on a good path to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer, he expected to raise rates this year despite complaints from the Liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Even when job creation slowed in August, the labor market saw solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of lifting.
And even if inflation continues to be under the annual 2% target of the central bank, the Fed's policymakers argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, with regard to the crowding in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began thrashing in late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record value in May as investors feared that a slowdown in China's economy would pull down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of the May peak.
The Fed's policy makers are making the uneasy situation in the market a comprehensive calculation when an interest rate rise is counted.
"In the absence of what has happened in financial markets, and reports of weakness in the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, lead researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
He now predicts he will wait for at least a month to get better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data on which to rely on the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The global economy's health is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow down" their monetary expansion in the market has triggered crashes around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are still more closely aligned, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts in order to better read the global economy's status.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated with movements in financial markets that seem disjointed with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy making push to raise rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions "despite the limited identifiable effects on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.
The Fed should prioritise concerns about financial stability only during the big crisis, such as the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Board of Standing Committee at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil doesn't even come close to this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a position of fear of a rate hike because markets have been upset," said Posen, president of the Institute for International Economics, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be getting on top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells for the public.
Yes, it's a Chinatown and not a Thai neighborhood.
The market / warehouse is the only contact point offering a stunning series of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a bit of motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to climb all the alleys.
If you're going to get hungry out of all this, go for a meal at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal business stall (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various sampling points.
What's on the stock: You need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find that at LAX-C.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold at large.
The new products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and others.
The spread of the meat is great, for example, fish - employees behind the counter will wash and bone, even fry it for you, if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezer section where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork guts, fish balls, regional sausage, free-store semi-trailers and more.
Who shop here: The owners of restaurants and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Broad avenues are met with shopping carts and high-rise carriages.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to a rack of cash.
Where it is: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounds a suburb of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: Lax-C has its own parking lots, which it shares with other stores and restaurants.
While the shop may be occupied, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways will remain on the old.
The acceleration to 150 km / h was rejected by the House.
It will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed of up to 150 km / h on selected sections of the motorway.
On Tuesday, she made the decision by the House when she approached an amendment to the Senate, which rejected the rate increase.
The amendment to the Road Act now heads to the president.
President Miloš Zeman has said in late April that the law allowing a stopgap-kilometre speed would be vetoed.
The transport minister, Dan Jiok (a YES), has been opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech highway network has not yet been built on such speed.
On Tuesday, the Chiefs backed the Senate's version of the law.
The approved amendment will now allow in line with the original government's proposal to increase the rate from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, in particular four-wicket.
The House first extended this option to the highways on which to ride in selected stretches at speeds of up to 150 km / h, but the Senate refused.
The MPs have now agreed on his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the transport minister, have also removed the authority of the transport police to have the final say in the provision of local communications, which are being cared for by the municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the House, also envisages that plumbing, plumbing, or public-lighting cables could be stored lengthways below the surface of the pavement.
Municipalities would thus be spared for the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of owner of the property concerned.
The amendment also aims to improve the protection of roads and facilitate the handling of towed vehicles to which owners do not report.
The new municipalities may be able to sell towed vehicles which do not subscribe within the six-month period after notification of the departure of their owners.
Municipalities will be able to rule out transit freight traffic through their territory following the roads of others and third classes under the threat of a fine as well as for the sleeping company.
The amendment also cancels the possibility of introducing electronic highway stamps instead of existing paper, which will also be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of the electronic system.
The school's ex-prime minister goes to trial.
He faces 10 years for the purported welcome of the bandwagon.
The case concerns the allegedly predatory project of welcoming the bandwagon.
Police wanted to prosecute a member of Susan Kail (SD) in this case, but the House of Commons did not issue it.
Under the legal qualifications of the case, they face both up to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two October days.
According to the state's attorney, Mansell, with the maco, caused damages of at least one million kronor, stemming from the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert opinion.
Former members of the city's leadership, according to the applicant, have been unlawfully allowed to obtain the property benefits of the company, which has been organising the welcome of the bandwagon.
According to the indictment of the then-chief executive of the city's services, education and culture, he was ordered to address the selection of five linked firms in the selection process.
When another company entered the contest to offer the lowest price, the council cancelled the competition.
The order then was to entrust the city to the administrator, and only Darothore, which was assigned to the City Council, applied to the competition.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges were designed to ensure that Darothore was awarded the award of a public contract for the organisation of the event The welcome of the bandwagon in Ústí nad Labem in the long term and coordinated, in a coordinated manner, at least contrary to the requirement to proceed with the care of a proper servicer, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, they are aware that Darothore will subsequently charge Darothore, after obtaining this contract, to charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Write-of-sale event, which will be disproportionately increased relative to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company has collected more than $5 million, according to the file for the project.
The city eventually paid just one part, roughly $1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was, according to the expert report, at least a million kronor.
Mansell has previously rejected any violation of the law.
I am innocent.
I don't understand this case, a former mayor has said that the city under his leadership has just followed up on a similar project from past years.
In 2008-2010, the event was provided by the Roxy II Agency.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mansell added.
The criminalists were originally going to accuse MPs of Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
But the House of Commons did not give it to the prosecution.
As a result, the criminalists have postponed the case in her case, but they calculate that Kaila will be charged after a congressional mandate expires.
The greeting of the bandstands was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift cheque for £5,000 to buy children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian policemen reportedly released a dog.
Then they added journalists to delete the record.
The Hungarian police said on the border with Serbia briefly detained a cameraman and forced him to delete a record on which the police dog allegedly hit the country's refugee.
But the Hungarian government disputes this accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed the migrants who crossed the border with Serbia over a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Police intervened against the fugitives, and one of them left a Syrian to attack a dog with a basket on its nose.
The dog of a man who shouted "Please please, I'm a refugee," he lounged, says Muzi.
The fact that Muzi was filming was noticed by one of the policemen, and he wouldn't let him go.
The reporter was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues at the site.
Police officers had taken Muzi to a dark place at the registration center for the refugees and asked him to show them what had been recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to the speaker of the Hungarian government of Zaltar Kovacs.
The behavior of the policemen declared it unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not to worry that the government would destroy legally obtained material.
Kovacs, citing the police report, had questioned Muzi's account of the event.
He said the police only wanted the journalist to show them whether they were on some of the footage, which they said they had a right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't make it easy.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to deter and do a little bit of fear, but they didn't attack with certainty," Kovacs says.
Unpredictable Champions League.
A win at City will kick us, believes Juventus
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, a corner of home City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic A-League game.
Neither team created a lot of opportunities, but the ball on the kick was we had longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," he assessed the match Pellegrini, whose team collected in a competitive match for the long 636 minutes.
That finalist last season, Juventus, was exactly the opposite of each other - after the first three rounds of the Italian League, as the defending champion, only a point, and with a score of 2: 4, is down to the 16th of the table.
That's why the turnaround at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us in," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three opponents - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala before the new rookie.
In Manchester they represented Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"It is, this victory is so important, perhaps because of it we will ride a winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
This is what my players deserve.
"Before our match goal, though, we could have collected at 0-2, but Gianluigi held us up," he praised the corner of Allegri goalkeeper Buffon.
"We've burnt a few good chances," Yayu Touré, a Booker of City, deadpanned.
We have to take the Champions League experience and try to get a better result next time.
Good-bye, Angela, goodbye to old Germany II.
Before we go on about the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media shake-up around is controlled by professionals.
From the needs of the media and from above.
And so let's stop for a little while.
Today, newspapers and media are full of babies bearing their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And that gives rise to a man - in a European man - automatically a sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't just come here for desperate children, notice the footage of the boats landing on the Greek islands, that the geeks aren't seeing them that much!
And somehow, recently, images of ships headed to Lampedusa, refugees from the French border at Menton, whose beautiful promenades lay down thousands of young men, disappeared.
Largely young black men.
And there were images of Callais, where these snowmen and black men were waiting to see if they could go through the tunnel beneath La Manche.
I don't think he's getting it.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of a fallacy.
So when it comes to the quotas for the runaways, it somehow concedes that it's not just about unfortunate children from Syria, but also about the vacuumed - for the older: Fashionably feckless - young men.
Whose mutterings look like they've just come out of a gym.
Just one personal experience.
This summer, on Turkish-Muslim-part of Cyprus, we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no ham.
And there were young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Ages 15 and 30.
They entered the beach, all dressed in designer clothing and shoes In hands, how else, smartphones.
That it is a private beach is not interested and workers - Turks, Muslims! - have evidently feared them.
They've taken all the chairs.
Who didn't lay on it and was in the sea, it was bad luck.
They were dressed like an American rap movie.
On top of the hat with a fingernail, white and coloured adidassic on the legs.
Then they circled the local beach bar and began to feast.
They put the tables around, crammed in beside the sitting snow and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace to a quiet place.
Incoming black people drank beer straight from the third - how in the USA?! - on the beach, they threw empty bottles around each other.
They kept yelling at each other.
It was not English, though.
Then they got into a drink of wine, also straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer bathing suits, especially the young ladies - in the water screaming and yelling, mothers with children and pensioners fled in dismay, and in half an hour they were no longer on the beach or in the pool or one non-black guest.
They've all gone.
Regardless of whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to speak of them.
The waiter said to me in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't," said the waiter.
I thought: "I know, they all had massive gold chains around the necks.
And one was on his neck about a 20-centimeter massive cross from gold.
And women were like gold.
"Drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them booed," the waiter replied.
Drugs don't fit, they don't even use.
They're smuggling something else entirely.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, it was still not that important to me.
I had no idea what would follow.
But the secret service and top politicians should have known it first.
They don't seem to know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.
And they go and go and go.
Today, the main problem for the European Union is that totalitarian-politicised politicians, as intellectuals, and tied to them by lobbying and economically important groups, have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognized taskforce in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not just them, also EU leaders and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images on the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of images of Moscow television in August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sluts at the station, but mostly - old German - Muslims welcomed their soulmates.
For weeks, they were babbling on the news on Czech television, as, according to some research, the Germans were almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
However, who was just a couple of days in Germany, he knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms more information.
For example, famous public opinion research organized by the ARD - the Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the statement, ARD wanted more than 50% of Germans to accept even more refugees a week ago.
That also melded our television.
However, they concealed what had been snapped in Germany the next day: That in an anticlimactic vote to the article it turned out that 94.5 per cent of Germans no longer wanted any immigrants - the poll involved 67 000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel in public in November 2010, five years ago, said: "Our efforts to develop a multi-cult society have totally failed."
She then said: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to live together have failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it has failed to identify strategies that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without being integrated.
But that is not the reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we just live happily alongside each other, so this approach has failed.
He's completely failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
Conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euromute Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, the MP for the SPD, the only one in the Euro-parliament who reportedly does not even have a graduation - yes, that is the one that Berlusconi has said in the EU parliament that he could play a supervisor in a concentrate - as he has done before.
It seems, in particular, under the impression of the recent statements by German politicians that Germany had crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the stats of countries that were victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have tried for years, at least outwardly, to deal with their terrible past the aggressor and the killer of millions?
Are they right to say that in Germany's soul, is the devil of aggression, superiority, and violence?
Did the chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, have been right, when all his strength halted the Highlanders' attempts to control the whole of the centre of Europe?
When did he say that the Welsh idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he should have.
When they shut it down, it began preparing for World War I.
The idea of the Welsh government, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably came back in another form.
After the Marxists' attempt to dominate the state, for example, with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany on the basis of ecology, for example, which was one of the main ideas of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say sunshine.
Germany's elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving all those fighters against the atom, the enthusiast seeking paradise for all, to quietly promote the old Empire and Nazi motto Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who everywhere want to do something differently and better, they have fully embraced the anti-warming parties, stopping nuclear power plants, etc.
And they have forgotten that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic stream that has seen all the Slavs as difficult vermin - since Karl Marx, who, after his parents, a Jew, was a German nationalist.
And, as the last statements by Schulze and German minsters show, openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of the leader of Germany.
Which must be listened to without speaking.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we say that immigrants are a very influenced group of voters, we have what we have.
And, behind this, it stands as always the capital, especially the German that it suits, and which is that Germany actually controls most of Europe's banks and the Union.
It has led the Germans into swamps of environmentalism and multicolturalism, and has brought them home and bring about millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the voices of the siren, will encounter soon on the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and start to revolt.
Germany can, once again, threaten its neighbors by force, again it may be a part of its population - but, it seems, an increasingly small part - ideologically infatuated, but in the end, the reality is as it always does.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim dormitories are already on fire.
What will the German government do when public protests from Germans against incoming Islamists erupt?
To whom Muslims will come for long living in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, follow the fear of Islamization of their country?
What will it do with the Germans, and with Germany, when the people who are raised loudly and publicly protest against a new Euro-oversized Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict that has created the promotion of sunshine ideology in Europe, the ideology of the elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the blunt negotiations toward disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of pushy retailers: Scare them to death.
All you have to do is knock and grind on you both in a way that a weaker nature doesn't have to stop.
A reviled head will set you down and drive the ragged ones, too, to walk away (or, rather, drive) an insistent seller and a reviled statue.
Maybe it's too bad that you can't even get a talking knockoff.
Even with us, there would be plenty of gutters and shivers.
Nice pink (Oxalis corniculata).
A tiny weed that tolerates the dry environment.
And so it is among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that belongs to expansive weeds, but the visually creates a pretty impression in terms of flowering.
Among the country's tiles is located.
She's inscrutable, she's thriving in our backyard.
It likes a drier environment, it's easy to adapt, modest and non-violent.
It creates leaves with a chaotic composition, but it is worth watching and taking pictures.
Beneath the scrum is the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breastfeeding
Brazilian paediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey women's knowledge of the importance of a good diet while breastfeeding through pictures of children lining up from a breast-painted display of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and novice mothers are advised to increase the daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new polls suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure to guide mothers.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affected the genetic making of their children and protected them from developing tumours.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively impacted the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's attempt to take the lead at the Today Show
The snub of Karl Stefanovic and Lisy Wilkinson to Canberra for coverage of the cost of the release of the Liberal leadership has failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
Morning show Nine projected from the national capital following the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Kochie and Samantha Armytage have been stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
On this tyranny of the distance, Aussie TV did not seem to care so much, because it accounted for 397 000 viewers in the five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers of the Today show.
Today, there was a minor increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was up to last Thursday (343 000).
Today has filled the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318 000, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the start of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has, on average, 44,000 viewers and Today 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than just parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
It added TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former star hit the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has, on average, a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could tighten a TV hit without star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night indicates a clear "yes."
The X Factor from Seven retained strong 1.136 million viewers, smoothly defeating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven have seen mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV quiz (from 17: 00 to 17: 30), which featured Andrew O'Keefe's average of 120,000 spectators.
The second half-hour (from 17: 30 to 18: 00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520 000 viewers and the other half an incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat averaged 620 000.
Thanks to a drop in ratings of The Chase Australia from the second night, Nine will believe that Hot Seat at 17: 30 will eventually prevail.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Order of Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who will he pick?
Secrets revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who will win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood will come to Bachelorette is shrouded in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stand up will certainly not reveal who the real one is, who will eventually get a rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezans Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before they remained just two, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's final
All three women lyrically reciprocated why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
Anyway, on the question, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?," their answers could function as a conduit for whoever gains the heart of Bachelor.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship from a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were pretty compatible and I still think about it during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really grounded woman, she's a lot of fun with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's a good chemistry between them.
They are well together and pleasant.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood could make a fine couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visit home, she realised that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realised this wasn't just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, her face was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.

Jarryd Hayne had few options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after its move to the United States and a lot of teams were consulted after its great start training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches left to sit Hayne for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the convert of the Australian rugby league in the first kick off the pitch at Tuesday's 20-3 draw at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also continuing to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of being chewed up in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also backed Hayne in public at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said Hayne also received encouragement from the special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the error and take care of just another game.
He has made his mistake during the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne.
It certainly wasn't the start in which Hayne and his massive Australian fanclub had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught up in the swearing when he left the field after the error and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his career in the NFL, he couldn't even imagine.
"That happens, you just focus on the next game and that's the whole thing," Hayne said
Hayne compared the trappings to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal-line led to the Troika of Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo of the fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin gather in a discussion on gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested while pointing guns at a Siberian ranch.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The abductor became the emigrants who sought to compensate the property.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the pair turned to the state to make amends under the Affordable Care Act.
The court first awarded them the required amount, over $2.8 million, but the appeals court changed their claim by admitting to them only less than £90, referring to the fact that the amount of the refund is determined according to the price rules of 1991.
Emigrants became Supreme Court, knocking back their initially jailed amount.
But the Treasury, which had the money to pay off, was facing complaints about the CPVO.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic circumstances that the compensation granted under the then existing legislation - even if it constituted a substitute in relation to the detached real estate - is now reaching only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the detriment of the interveners, as in the restitution of eligible persons who have been seeking their rights at least since 1995 and which have not been able to obtain reimbursement before," Judge Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the CPVO had been placed on the part of the emigrants.
"He has repeatedly spoken to the general courts to proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistency is not interpreted in the interests of the claimants and that the purpose of the restitution of the law of the former totalitarian state of the former totalitarian state is always achieved," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Stuart DVA now turns Radka Fishaar.
Radka Fichess, incidentally, became the world's youngest Evita when, in 1998, she turned the role of wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timea Rice in the Prague Theatre of Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says: "To this day, the intensity of Evita's power of performance has not matched."
Evita is not just an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monica Absolon recommended it to the role of the first lady of Argentina.
I saw Monica in Evita three times and it was definitely inspirational to me.
This is where I suddenly saw a completely new concept.
I am quite a fan of more modern adaptations, but this one is particularly poignant.
"Director Andrew Sokola is original, secluded and present," Fishaus notes.
A poignant transfer of the musical scepter between the two singers will occur at Monica Absolon's birthday concert on September 27, from 19 hours at the Studio DVA theatre.
The evening will culminate in the tracks from the musical Evita.
The experience will surely be a common duet of Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Use your cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Andrew Sokol will also depart from the overhead pulpit as he steps in for the filming of Charles Roden in the role of President Perón.
For the sake of the public, more dates until May 2016 were added to the sale.
Fifth Czech learning of the world musical Evita puts the Studio DVA in partnership with The Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Monika Absolon was originally enrolled in Andrew Sokola's main female role.
Charles Roden, president of Perón, and the role of Che Peter Stromechk, appears alongside her.
Legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with the English texts of Michael Prostějic sounds in the submission of a live orchestra led by Christopher Mark, who was involved in the first introduction at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after policemen fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police gunned down rubber bullets into a mob of demonstrators against the draft of a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupanhi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishop Prasad Dhakal, a senior district officer, says more than 1000 protesters gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal says police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, it says.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last of the week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the group's ethnic group Madhesi say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and have eased their political clout.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by ethnic group Tharus, which demands the emergence of its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 policemen.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into a province - a big step toward a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal that has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has continued since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers in Kathmandu voted on the provisions of the draft constitution this week, and officials said the new charter should be accepted by Sunday.
We must not panic now.
After a loss to the ice mastermind, you couldn't even manage a home duel with the Shapps (3-5).
Aren't you worried about the same disastrous entrance to the extremist as a year ago?
I hope it doesn't happen again.
Peace Folk.
NHC predicts a 60 per cent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a probability of 60 per cent in the emergence of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Centre said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Anties also has a 60 per cent probability in the emergence of a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, forecasters said in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it was launching a campaign to collect $11 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees overrun by European states in the run-up from war-torn and poor countries. Every selected amount of Google will double.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
A report on her blog was published by Google employee Rita Masoud based on personal experience as the seven-year-old fled with her family from Kabul.
"We travelled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigrant crisis in Europe, more and more families, like that, are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among the 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all the contributions made via the google.com / chanerelief to $5.5 million will double.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since the Second World War, the most coming from Syria-torn four-year war, which has only driven 4 million people this year.
Many people also run from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly obese diabetics, weight-loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of losing surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery to lose weight than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data takes a long time to view," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in surgery to lose weight, who wrote an editorial on the new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery to lose weight, bariatric surgery is used to reduce the stomach's various methods.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was performed on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the relationship weight relative to height, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher suggests overweight people and people with a value above 30 are seen as obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital of Min-Sheng in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in the treatment procedures of type-3 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
Average BMI among those who underwent surgery declined according to a study from 31 to 24.5 towards the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI of those was not given surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and in part in 28 cases.
In the drugs treated to the group, it was only up to 1 per cent for comparing diabetes and in part to only about 2 per cent of patients.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol proved "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient levels of haemoglobin A1c in the blood that reflects the ongoing blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers report.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin of A1c fell from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, this value remained at about 8 per cent in the treatment group.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to chief researcher Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group lost more weight compared to a group of gastrectomy (18.7 against 14.2 kg), reaching larger drops of BMI (7,4 against 5.1) and haemoglobin of A1c (3.1 percent against 2.1 percent) and were more likely to remission diabetes (46.9 percent against 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Though a new study has not shown improvements in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it's a reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, it states.
Blackstone also further claims that people and their doctors should start taking the weight really seriously after dropping the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that bind their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A Tibetan leader in Buddhists has called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to a study of ethics, at the beginning of its 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that in the current circumstances, human interest should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also emphasized that the response of Western European countries, however admirable it was, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was just a temporary solution.
"Taking care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you'll have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he pointed out.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems, "he said.
In addressing the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions on George Bush after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack and says the US "violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised that the way to resolve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested a sanitation agent in the past 4 years
The toxicology centers around the United States reported a nearly 400-percent boost from 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 that polled a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to a toxicology center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia's toxicology center, the number of living sanitizers in children under the age of 12, which were reported to the control centers of the poison, increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children are getting to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitisation devices deliberately, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking a sanitizer for cheap fuss.
The teenagers reportedly mixed a sanitizer with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be drawn to the attractive scent of the device.
"The kids aren't thinking about hurting them," said Lopez.
A lot of the more attractive (sanitising devices) are the ones that are perfumed.
The dipositions are sanitised funds with the scent of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very tempting for children.
The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.
Particularly in small children, several locusts can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," he told Fox 4 in Kansas City medical director of the control toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital, Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey either, but people will leave these sanitised devices outside and when children get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four loaves of sanitized reagent with the scent of strawberries in the school and was retaliated for treatment on the alert.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah voiced slurred words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," she told CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange to be sanitised funds from the reach of children.
Out of alcohol poisoning, some sanitised funds were associated with death.
In 2013, two women died from Ontario after swallowing a sanitizer that contained toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Health officials thought that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students in a fourth year in northern New York were planning to poison their "evil" teachers by deploying antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has banned their presence in the room.
Police assessed the thwarted plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Rumours: No discrepancy in team Celtic
Griffiths bagged talk of a mismatch at Celtic, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he will turn it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that new reinforcements from January will disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
A penalty from the first half in ADAMA Rooney secured Aberdeen's close victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, which gave the Dons a five-point lead between himself and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of mismatch
This situation has drawn gossip about the discrepancy in Celtic, which has been denied by Griffiths, who insists he and his teammates do not work under any pressure from the increased oversight in the preparations for the game with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bore the Netherlands - de Boer
Former guard Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands, Ronald de Boer, argue that Dutch fans of football have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them anymore because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently ambassador to Ajax, says: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of the games of Celtic, and why?"
Because there aren't Rangers anymore.
The people here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is great tension at the Old Firm game and not only are the people of Scotland watching these games.
I turn things back to good, commit to Deila.
Roony Dealia admitted Celtic were a bit stumbling, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things back to good.
The defeat by Malma and the following fall out of the Masters was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who only had 10 players and now with a stick at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says: "Celtic have had a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about the current events.
We're exactly the same - but we need to keep going.
Really, we really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested he had already identified some of his January goals, the head of Rangers Mark Warburton is worried about big-buying possums and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity team from Ibrox.
The former head of Brentford states: "The January transfer window is very different from that summer."
The players who come in the summer have a whole pre-season for housing, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's exit target suggests retirement
Swansea Michu, who was linked with Celtic in the transfer window, indicated he could retire after his contract was expired.
The 20-year-old shooter has had problems with a prone ankle for two years and has not been able to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA for comment against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on that defender was later cancelled - it is the third red card issued by referee Collum, who was called off.
Neilson is behind his claims and states: "I have not questioned the integrity, I have not commented on the performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecaster
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting he was singing a song with text aimed for former Hearts Rudolf Shapps.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecaster in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a rampant moment," the attacker said, continuing, "I can safely say I'm not going back to Tynecaster unless it's in the uniform of Celtic."
Council in Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the advice of Dundee United still believes in repairing the situation by the team's current management - but admits that the decline in the playground has to end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boy again for action, "Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is keen for 'ugly victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen team had to desperately cling on against Hamilton Accies to get their seventh league victory along and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty of the first half in Adam Rooney's serve.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, whether it's driving or the league, without winning this type of games."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged while overall UK unemployment rate rises
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the rate in the UK (5.5 per cent), as data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the period of three months, the number of workers now stopped at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The secretary of state of Scotland, David Mundell, said in a commentary on the latest data: "A long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It's almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In these 12 months, we witnessed further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment grew, while unemployment fell.
Why I witnessed the executions in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will watch the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I will sit in the viewing gallery in the death row of Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials to witness his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm beginning to worry.
Why am I doing this?
I have accepted this invitation because it is a good way for me to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because there are often more requests than vacancies, it is carried out with a morbid lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has cut the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever will be selected will watch the whole execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting alongside Richard Glossian's closest friends, and I've made a special bond with him through months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like that kid.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be able to get a notebook, and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to memorize all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the chivalry the way he's going to like it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have formulated it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Gloin had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help practices against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be at my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I've created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there is a great likelihood that he is innocent of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is bad.
And it is from this perspective that I will watch his death.
I can't say I'm really objective.
To this end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is an experience of seeing a man I love to die an unnecessary death.
Man escaped from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after being ejected by a man from Canning River.
Betting a man from Pemarket that he was going to run by police didn't come out after he got into a shallow muddy water just metres from a policeman who tried to peacefully persuade him to go back to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in in the incident in excess of Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I won't go out, just come for me,'" said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to dip his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and police negotiations. "
"People sometimes try to do funny things in the run," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove the car into a ditch to avoid a bus and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning for biathlon Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims the organisers tried to spy on him and threatens to quit the race
Peeter Moody accused organiser Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy on him last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He focused on the organisers and the department of integrity Racing Victoria and based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with the late-scratching Lady Tatai in maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation regarding Lidarin's positive yield on cobalt, which he couldn't explain.
He bit into the language on allegations of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes out of you all at the same time," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I've said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach.
I'd have to consider what I'd do with my license.
Previously, Moody released a bomb in his interview that the department's integrity had tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will be named after the issue - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out information about things that are being carried out in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an effort to catch me, they completely failed me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, the current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundra, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are also aware of this today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a pair of balls and arrange for people outside the coach's position to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them something to think about.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will push them and carry the burden on them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family and I can walk away.
The level of frustration the coach has increased with the long-term investigation for cobalt including Lidari and the recent scratching in it has made him feel "he could have the hours of his licence on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, described the rule of treatment on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after being taken to the feet by a clay bandage or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
Someone from my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of obscenities on the day of the race, to which the organisers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
Cobram driver who drove away was arrested
Police arrested a man who was hit by a cyclist over the weekend in Cobras and after the collision left.
The cyclist has been transported to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by an aute on the main road of Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove off without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia himself admitted to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns a blow to rivals for wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, has criticized the footballing of his players as "setting the schedule" of two NRL favourites premiership.
Trent Robinson, the Sydney Roosters coach, said the referee allowed the players Storm to "wrestle" his players during a controversial victory for team Storm in the finals qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, the Brisbane Broncos coach, made a slightly veiled mention at Strorm after his team won finals qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "parade" of rugby league and, according to him, two of Queensland were not "too big" to wrestle.
Bellamy defended the footage of his players and said they were focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his confidence as his team was criticised by two leading coaches, which can mean they have a fear of defeating from the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and tech in the last year, we've only put the emphasis on contact during the footy, and that has meant a turnaround for us.
Trent has been here for three years and he's obviously training a great team so he's probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come at this time of year.
Bellamy has defied Bennett's idea of "thrilling football" and reminded his Mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right in that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours.
I remember in 2010, St George was criticised for being a boring team and Wayne then said he didn't really care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that strikes him off, especially his young bookmakers with their speed.
You would want to play that kind of football if you had this type of players available.
He said that view in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two bookmakers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about the game against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they were getting big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out that there were more gates in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more tries in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and not score tries interesting?
I think it's the agenda.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again at some point.
The Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from morning next Tuesday.
Serbian man granted bail of $200,000 for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland has been granted bail of £200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of the drug from yacht Solay, who came from South America through Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen at a meeting together charged in the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential judgment of life for possessing cocaine of commercial quality, lawyer Maksimovice has defended the defence on that there was no evidence that he owned the whole quantity and that he could be in the cafe entirely by chance and innocently.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan thought Maksimovic would escape.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he said on Wednesday.
At the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
The mother and stepfather of Maksimovice, together, offered bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the affidavit by both people, it is clear that the embedded bail of $200,000 is a real financial burden to them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts themselves were clearly inadequate because the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he surrender to both an Australian and a Serbian passport, daily to report to police and will abide by the curfew from 18 in the evening to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used phone girl to lure paedophiles to send pictures
The paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to retrieve pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl while she was asleep, then volunteered for her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photographs of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then went through and discovered that she was missing the phone and then found him in the hands of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then the analysis computers found the address and discovered "disturbing" searches on the site using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then told police that his reason was "to lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending to be a police officer and scare them."
Fiscal Representative Eilidh Robertson said for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted he was doing the search on the computer, but says he just wanted to pretend he was a police officer to scare the paedophiles.
He was asked for his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send others.
According to him, he was doing it to lure them
He claims he got mad at drunkenness and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: 'When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw naughty pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was heard talking about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty to filing charges relating to accepting or providing inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, breaking bail conditions on January 25 and failed to appear in court on March 24 of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register because he can argue that there was "no major sexual subtext in his act."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the ruling for October due to reports of social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about the other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders register before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivered a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, the Africa's oldest leader, previously fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall has become viral in social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by allegations by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous threats to kill them, which warned them against shutting down Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month he was shutting down and provoking him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the House of Commons Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Goes, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to hinder Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number not shown, but is named 'death'," he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends up in parliament and as soon as they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity is not working.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, has "concerns" about threats to MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is poised to cut the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancels 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and cost the company's business services.
HP later this year will share two companies listed on the stock exchange and separate the computer and printer store from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and will occur in the fourth quarter, HP says in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, the CEO of HP and the chairman of the board, which will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores that will help businesses transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a seminal society, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have the company's announcement of annual income of more than $50 billion and "will be aimed at providing uncompetitive integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will be the distribution of a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment, and whose garage in Palo Alto was dubbed the "birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has been going through a massive reorganisation to manage the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest manufacturer of PC and one of the biggest tech companies in America, is the latest from this sector based on the belief that the closely-specialized firm has better results.
Captain of the arsenal Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again on Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means Wilshere will surely miss at least another four English games and, from the perspective of history, his involvement in the next summer's European championship, is obviously uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then went back to the former form during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten the career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It did not concern his ankles or injuries he suffered before.
This could be from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
Here, too, a nasty pattern emerges.
The survey by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has only played in 65 league games of arsenic from a total of 157:
From a wider perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08, he was one of two Premier League clubs who lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you go back through injuries, you have a vulnerable period, time you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal are starting a campaign in the A-League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to take up.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreala Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain the balance and let the players who need it, exhale," says Wenger.
While Arsenal are the clear favourite to proceed from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not beaten in a total of 41 games after they kept the campaign "unbeatable" last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees on Wednesday night.
That was earlier this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal have learnt from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco and remains a distant hope of leading the club to a first victory in the European Cup.
"This commitment is tremendous," says Wenger.
The arsenal never happened.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is striking, especially given how the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever in terms of suicides among young men within 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to address this problem, she identified Campaign Against Living miserably (CALM) of 2015 as the Year of the Much, whose aim is to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help in the event of need.
At the heart of this struggle lies a friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 secondary school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Equally for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends is half a chance of mental problems.
But for friendship to work, it must, of course, be achievable first.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often prioritised before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound influence on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire and playmaker explained recently, money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but their personalities, which shone through a friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moment of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained:... "my role as a listener of people who feels depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about issues.
Friends are one of the programmes that will arise in my memory as I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He emphasizes small moments in men's friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of desperation, but long-term support must come from a greater close, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to the FrendsFest hosted by Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely overhauled for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Series Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central Station from start to finish - whole 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidim and Edinburgh Cavani after shooting the goalkeeper against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored at his debut in the Masters and helped PSG beat Sweden's Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani both scored on Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Lize Masters final comfort victory 2-0 against Malma at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the gate less than four minutes after his debuts at the Masters, and this player PSG sent the French champions a victory, then threw a few chances, finally raising their lead when the Cavani shot a shot through the head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the team Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they do not focus only on qualifying in the knock-out rounds, but to improve their journey to the quarter-finals that they have seen in each of the previous 3-year-olds.
But even if they got three points, it wasn't the classic performance of the team of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was marauding ahead of the goalkeeper and later was replaced against his home team and the club in which he began his famed career in 1999.
"In the A-League, it's not easy to win out or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our adversaries a problem and looking comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things we'll need to improve with the process," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't shoot one or two overs more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, who at home suffered a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in League One this weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked by both the man who sprinkled PSG in Europe to a new level after the transfer from Manchester United, which ran last month, and showed why, when he ran on pass to Marc Verratti in defence of Malma and a beautiful finish, he sent the ball past Johan Wilanda into the far corner of the gate.
However, if anyone was expecting it to trigger a grand victory for PSG, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, has entered with 9 internationals in a basic set and five defenders and two drawn-out bookmakers were a tough opponent.
But apart from the Nikola Djurdjic missile, which only narrowly missed the far corner of Kevin Trappa's goal in the 34th minute, they did not offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves had been ordained for the benefit of the attack by wickets and a miserable finish that was neither good nor from Ibrahimovic, who could not fire five times in the first half, and was then disappointed as his missile arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved a lot more appropriate when it came to preparing the chances for his teammates and it was just from his innings when Di Maria sent a curling shot that ended in the Willows gate after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour's game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent off for a line-out in the sixth goal this season after Ibrahimovic nailed him down the pitch from Maxwell's left wing.
That ended Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they might gain something out of the game, and only a great save by Wilanda from the great vicinity wrecked the hope of David Luiz, and the score remained unchanged even as the goal of the shooting Ezequiel Lavezzi was unrecognised at the end of the match.
Coach of the Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class higher over his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the League of Masters took place in December last year."
Since then, we have played only a Swedish league that is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
For them, it was a fascinating match.
Glencore earned $2.5 billion worth of stock sales
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which was hit by a collapse in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion from the sale of shares in its large-scale plan to reduce debt.
Glencore said in its statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay down debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with the price of commodity prices, as China's slowdown in the economy lowers demand and ignites sparks of destruction across markets.
The issue of rights has sent the price of Glencore to the top in London's stock market in early morning stores on Wednesday.
Shares surged 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 per cent above.
Glencore revealed last week that sales of $2.5 billion are part of broader plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated about a third
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pence per share, which marked a 2.4per cent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 per cent for the group.
Concerns about the extension of China's growth have reduced the price of iron ore by nearly half, and coal, copper, and other commodities have plummeted by 20 to 40%.
White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the president welcomed in November, the report said.
US president and first lady Michelle Obama invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks end.
"President Xi's visit presents an opportunity to consolidate US-China relations and urges cooperation in addressing issues in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for constructive debate about the disagreements of the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet with several technical leaders of the US on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the September UN meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including concerns about Washington from the alleged cyberespionage of China and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
As the refugee crisis unravelled the Schengen area.
An emergency flare launched by Germany is far from a European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to address the problem of refugees: It will be more systematically sorting out migrants and asylum seekers once they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing for the future distribution of refugees under quotas on the basis of quantities that are increasingly distant from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160 thousand refugees, the EU's interior ministers have changed the priority.
Rather than taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is ahead of the need to filter out those arriving already today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary to manage migration," it stresses in the text of the pro-government ministers on Monday in Brussels.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU is finding it at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases the pressure.
It restores border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power makes it clear that no free movement in Europe is possible without it.
As evidence, it has served already that Austria and Slovakia have joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensities.
Hungary had done so long ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under Schengen rules.
That it is a domino effect, but it also sees blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris now is the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensely during a private conversation with their three colleagues in Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is difficult to implement.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, they have already been registered and identified with fingerprints of two-thirds of the new arrivals.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point in its territory, because it fears more than others to keep the camps in which refugees would accumulate on its behalf.
The real black hole remains Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as much as arriving in Italy last year.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they went through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and which is waiting for a new government, folded its hands into the lap.
That is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of the now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to introduce checkpoints as soon as possible, but has given no number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece are subject to all of Europe," the EU's interior ministers agreed on a mobilization on this front on Monday.
So it is going to deploy European Frontex border control teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen its oversight of the islands.
"Appropriate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
In terms of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the emergence of real European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is coming.
The new emergency situation of the Eighties, as such, has pushed the question of binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees, already established by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande in early the year.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained in the text approved by the majority of the twenty-eight on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
A single firm pledge includes a redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already reached in June during a hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, reportedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists that killed an avalanche in the French Alps.
German nationality, according to authorities, is also a woman who has survived as one of the affected eight-member groups.
Previous media reports said it was Polk.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalised in the city of Briancon on her thigh bone.
The dead were made up of AFP largely by the 1940s.
"The rescue operation is over, also the bodies of the victims were taken to identify in Briancon," the prefect of Hautes-Alpes-Alpes Pierre Besnard said.
The accident happened around noon in the mountain area of Pelvoux under the height of the mountains of Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 metres.
"The sudden avalanche was a wide 250-meter and high about a metre," noted the head of the rescue, Nicolas Colombani.
A vast amount of snow fell on the eight-member group at about 3900 metres.
The Weather Service has not warned in the area before the weather.
Trpišovský before the game with Braga: Finally, the real Europe.
Coach Henry Trengove, at his premiership in the Championship, has been able to go through the footballers of the Liberec over the leaders of the European League to the base group, and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
The Slovan at the introduction of the main stage of the competition will welcome the finalist of 2011 Braga and, according to the coach, wants to impose her playing style.
After all the nerves in the knock-out side, when every goal and every situation could take you out on the road to a mock-up group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every insurgent gate, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by a double-match.
"I'm looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before that was just a qualification," Trpeshish said at a news conference.
Braga considers herself the top team.
They will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The match might just be harder to do that he doesn't have that name, but he has a player in his cadre that I suspect Manchester has given three goals.
"It's an excellent whole at the top-team level," Trpishovský said.
But he doesn't see Braga as a bright favourite.
I take it we're playing at home, so outsiders are definitely not.
"I think we have shown in the domestic competition even in the pre-rounds that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost from 11 duels this season just the opening Super Bowl in Pilsen.
He believes Liberec can even impose his style on Braze.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time being uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They're playing at 4-4-2 with a rapid transition to the attack phase.
"He's a very tough opponent, we've discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the field," Trpishovský said.
We've studied a lot in the pre-rounds, which has been very helpful, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have also adapted to training.
"And we certainly do, even if it's going to be very difficult to play by our notes," he added.
Student films dominate the Sand, beginning an international festival.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries have signed their works to contest the 15th annual International Festival of Students in the Sand.
Four dozen of them, which the board made up of students and educators sent to the finals, will be projected from 15 to 18 October in the cinema of the Porrod.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said a spokesman for the Jim Charbid festival.
Every year, the festival has its special subject that unfolds from the festival's theme tune.
This year it's a detective.
The director of this year's famous evening, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film, and theatrical productions.
"And of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in this year's attention," said Chartrand.
Visitors will see the selection of the most intriguing of student-making - films played, animated and documentary.
Evaluating them will be an international jury, to which, for example, the winner of last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Organizers of the festival as each year prepare an accompanying programme.
Is Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Andrew Ruml, a professional player at didgeridoo Andrew Smeykal, the Turboshansone group Mission?, a playful band of Evil or, for example, Peter Hapk with a recap of Life on the Bar.
The festival will also host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first brings the alumni of the scripted film school and the holder of the prestigious award, among which he is absent from the World Press Photo 2014, John Aishbrenner.
The second exhibition approaches the atmosphere that panned in Nepal following the tragic earthquake.
On a beheading with the visitors arrives by cameraman and documentarian Martin Chech, mute film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber and the sand-haired Brukner, Novotny and Hlach in the studio of sculptor John Novotny baptizing his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we will also remember Miroslava Onnap, patron of the FAMO in the Sand, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy to live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop common ties as well as film crafts," the spokesman said.
This will certainly help the forum, where students can meet with film professionals, take several job auditions at the same time, and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the emergence of the Neighborhood Higher Training School film in the Sand.
Its founders, spouses of Vladan and Milos Tercha, organized their first year in 1997.
He went to the sixth grade once in two years.
In the bankruptcy of the CK, insurance companies cover clients' entitlements in full.
Insurance companies should cover clients' claims in the bankruptcy of the travel agent in full.
She made a decision on Wednesday by the House when she approved a revised amendment to the terms of the business in tourism.
Travel agents will be able to replace insurance against the bankruptcy of a bank guarantee, according to the draft, which is headed for consideration in the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay the client's entitlements as well as the agreed limit do not agree.
The Department for Local Development is insisting on the adjustment, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to put an end to insurance travel agents against the crash when it comes to pay.
But the proposal has been criticised by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will have to either quit or go abroad.
Minister for Local Development Karla Noble (for YES) pointed out that cases where insurers have not paid full refunds are not the Eurokomformers.
She pointed to this year's Constitutional Court decision, which confirmed that the client was entitled to a full refund of the money, regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will be given enough information about the management of the travel agents and will be able to determine the right limit, stressed the Sept.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be feasible," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee will not work, because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agents will have to end their actions or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
A member of the presidents of the Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD), with Kalouskou's concerns on the basis of a survey among the Member CK, disagreed.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance," he said.
The statement of the insurance companies does not consider Okamura relevant; there is no official written observations in that sense.
They are told, however, whether the travel agencies will consist of involvement, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Before the provision was warned, John Fischer (ODS), which referred to the opinion of the rival Association of the Czech Republic, and its party colleague, Peter Bendl, who spoke of deleting the steps of the Czech travel agency.
Travel agents, according to the Fischer, will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer says.
Her proposal to launch the disputed passage of the House has not been approved.
Neither did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) with the proposal to return the draft to the committee because of the alleged violation of the civil code.
Phil pointed to the travel agencies, which they think may be a threat to consumers.
The rapporteur, Mr Martin Berdych, (YES), in view of the Constitutional Court's verdict, withdrew its proposal, which would limit the liability of the insurance undertakings where they could not have known that the insurance performance would not cover the entire risk.
In the news, it will not initially propose a minimum $4 million limit for travel agents offering tours of air travel, and a million-dollar limit for office selling, for example, bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 per cent of planned sales from sales of tours.
However, the premium performance limit will need to be such that, in the event of bankruptcy, the travel agent will cover all customer claims.
The standard, even after adjustments, stipulates that the travel agencies will need to re-list the travel agencies for the trip to which the tour operator organises the trip.
Travel agents will have to submit to insurance companies before closing the contract, among other data on the management and number of tours.
The approved amendment of the Public Accounts Committee also provides for further regular information by the insurance companies.
Travel agents will have to supply them each month with data on the number of passengers and sold-out tours, the total cost of the tours and the amount of advances and sales for the tours and the vouchers for them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agent has not complied with any of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will invite it, according to the draft, or it will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts if a breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of customers.
The amendment also has to re-edit the funding of the mountain service.
The Ministry for Local Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its request, which will be submitted by the end of April for another year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money last year, the financial plan of spending and the outlook for the next two years.
According to the law-enforcement association, he hadn't figured out what would happen if the insurance company had a contract.
This will not be allowed to organise and the clients who purchased the trip before the expulsion of insurance are to lose it, according to the association.
In that case, the CK will suffer a significant loss, and may fail, even if its management has been in good shape.
One of the ways that travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be an action for a replacement.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and we will act only as agencies in our market, said Vice-President John Pope.
The proposed amendment also includes the Institute of Banking Guarantee, but it is not sufficiently thought that it can be implemented in practice, as the Bank's guarantee cannot sound at an uncapped amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in practice has been de facto unnecessary.
In a two-year horizon, the new EU directive will be required to rework the law.
A total of 942 active insured travel agents are now operating in the Czech market.
This year, only three CBs have ceased their operations.
The country's travel agents sell overseas tours worth about $20 billion each year.
Merkel: We must improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must stand to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
It was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after negotiations with the German country's prime ministers.
At the same time, it has again appealed to the distribution of refugees, who have already arrived in the EU, among the member countries of the twenty-eight.
We need to do more to help countries where refugees are leaving, or in which they are delayed after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will deal with dignified conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, the German chancellor said, according to which a stronger financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organizations could be such a signal.
"The foreign countries are also supporting the German government in order to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis on European countries," Merkel said.
The country's prime minister, Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, in this regard at the press conference, said he expected real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas in the long term rejects, inter alia, the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke have also spoken out to speed up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible whether they have a chance to stay here.
It is also needed for authorities to be able to start more quickly with the integration of foreigners, the province's prime minister has said.
There is also a need for most of the money that Germany gives to childcare, it has served just to integrate those with a chance to get asylum.
We need more teachers so the refugees can handle the Germans.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if we manage to integrate, they can become an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon bagged the diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity with the claim that it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's episode of the HBO project, Greenlight interrupted the actor booked into a series of Brown when highlighting the need for alternative perspectives on black actors in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the film and not on the cast of the show," Damon says.
Shocked, Brown responded with disbelief and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian came into the air.
Damon and Brown have allied themselves with joint-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finale of the show.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whatever the director is, how they will treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character that's a hooker wrapped up by a white pimp.
Producer of the expensive White People has championed the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights of directing the film; Damon retorted that their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded in a disagreement with a comment from Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the writing clip, "Matt Damon jumping into the talk of a single black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversity is TAK BÍI that it hurts."
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 licks since it was published.
Damon's comment comes as the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After being killed by teenage Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement has picked up a national effect and has pushed for lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminating practices against coloured people.
In February, the singer-songwriter made hints at the movement while placing the nominees in the Album of the Year during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent head of the Black Lives Matter presented a statement in response to the issue of the personality of Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hateful group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders said.
Damon was recently reported on the list of entertainers, producers and the media of moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation or was already met with the Pope is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has first winner"
Professional climber and pipper Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and took home one million dollars.
In a competition that has just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants have been able to overcome all the obstacles on the line.
During the finals this season, two men have struggled into the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last hurdle was a 30-second climb for more than 220 m long rope.
Britten took the climb first and that within the set limit and became the first contestant to overcome a sizable 4-section in the American Ninja Warrior, however, Caldiero surpassed it by a full three seconds and the contest won.
Caldiero provided an interview for the newsagents! News immediately after his hard-earned victory and was to know he was still in shock from winning the main prize of $1 million.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac told E! In response to his win.
"So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finals and why Britten won't receive any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to whoever finishes the track fastest.
"If the track participates in more contestants, the prize will be won with the best time," said Weed.
Even if the profits of the main prize had changed his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he's holding a grudge.
He is glad to be able to achieve what he has done.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and a woman. "
Geoff told me: "If he was to be someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America's Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Tigers from Detroit passed just close to Minnesota Twins
Minneapolis -- For tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the pink garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is now at the top of the American League's central division.
Just narrowly averted the Tigers "defeat when they beat the Minessota close to 5-4 at the Target Field stadium in Tuesday's game.
The twins have missed a chance to approach the Houston Astros team and seize the second wild card in the American League.
Even if only for one night, for Detroit, it was the return of the word to Z, which was so elusive during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun and it doesn't matter how," the manager of the Tigers Brad Ausmus said.
A pitcher of Tigers Alfredo Simon kept his offensive line-up and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took on another in the sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) allowed opponents 6 1 / 3 launches and 3 lunches.
It was his only third consecutive game of the last nine games.
"I want to end up with convincing results this year," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into a game when you often sit on the bench and that's why I want to get really into the game." "
Batsman Tigers Victor Martinez has hit three times and made 2 lunches and his first dropped point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last June game, in which he has scored four times in the game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned forward pretty well," Ausmus said.
"He looked good at practice, he bowled noticeably better, and he managed to bring it into the game."
Thanks to three lunches at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins have won the biggest chance of a return back to the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton gained a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
The real fielder Aaron Hicks scored a point thanks to a set bat and Simon spooked Brian Dozier before he was replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent of Mauer, and in front of him had batsman Miguel Sana, who detonated the ball and hanged two meths and left behind the banner of Drew Verhagen.
With two players on the bases and a chance for retribution in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send the third sweeper over two bases.
Plouffe has gained 27 circulation over two bases this season and fed the league table.
Detroit held the ninth inning, Mauer getting two downloaded points, and Bruce Rondon secured the score 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander ranked Sana on three pitch.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes's game.
The Tigers got three lunches in the first two shifts against a retired batsman who went into the game after more than a month's break because of inflammation of the wrist muscles.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift I already felt I was going to pitch better."
After he resisted the onslaught in the first inning, he released Hughes one point to second-rower Ian Kinsler.
Two exits for the right fielder J.D. Martinez handed out Victor Martinez, who first hanged all the bases.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
Third-grader Nick Castellanos followed with a point on the right side of the field and scored another lunch, but Victor Martinez was draped as he attempted to reach third base.
The Tigers added in the second innings when pitcher James McCann and fielder Anthony Gose got two and covered one point and a 3-0 lead on the resulting whiteboard.
"That put us in the kneecaps," said the manager of Twin's Paul Molitor.
"He missed the ball very well, but he got him to the right place."
Hughes, who won on the number of overthrows, finished third innings with no points and replaced him with right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran off three bases, got six launches and 4 strays.
Note: Anibal Sanchez, the right pitcher of the Tigers, ended the game with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be cared for by Dr James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the list of injuries thanks to outstretched muscle in the shoulder since mid-August, should take on Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return after injury and take on the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris has been replaced as the left pitcher of David Price, he has a score of 1-1 after 4 games.
Since August 20, however, he has not yet played for the outstretched muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play a third mutual game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening economy to wider world
It is imperative to open up the economy to the wider world for boosting growth, said President Xi Jinping's group, whose job is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said on the 16th session of the group's central leadership group to deepen overall reform.
Promoting the opening in rotating reforms will deliver new impetus and vitality, it will also provide a new scope for economic growth, Xi says.
The leading group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the relaxation of border control policies, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration residency system.
In a statement, a negative list is set to identify sectors and businesses that are off limits for investment.
This system will be gradually tried and improved through test programmes.
This move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensuring the legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement says.
The government will also release controls on the powers that delegate to firms, and make sure the companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also indicates that China will allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies funded from abroad and will provide better services to them," it says in a statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," by optimising the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring rights advocates practice and develop a professional judge and a prosecutor has also been discussed at the meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and the leaders of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
There may be a new berth in the Karlovar region.
According to the Deputy Governor of Karlovar County, Jakuba Pnik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the country is sufficient and the sub-arrangements should be made on the basis of an agreement between the separate hospitals.
But there are also opportunities for expansion of care.
For example, in the surgical ward ward, there could be centres of one-day surgery, where surgical courses would be performed according to a set design, which do not require hospitalisation for more than 24 hours.
In which particular hospitals the workplace for one-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.
In Karlovy Vary, a laser centre could become a laser centre with the possibility of using laser technique on a skin condition.
The concept also recommended the emergence of an apathetic centre that would take care of patients with disabilities of the brain who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthetist-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility to the Hospital Island, where such care exists.
Additional beds, which appear to be inadequate in the Karlovar region, are beds of follow-up and, in particular, the beds of the long-term (LDN), whose capacity in the Post is inadequate and, above all, should be closely related to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as a bed of rehabilitation and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends the concept.
As she points out, beds of subsequent care are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There, it could be used to leave buildings after centralisation.
Last but not least in the Karlovar region absences social-health beds focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are scarce throughout the Republic, so it could serve for other counties as so-called Alzheimer's.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also be prepared to implement the so-called "follow-up" beds to be released by the financial means of European subsidies.
"These are beds that will be based on supespecialized care and will create room for translation of patients following surgery, for example, after cardiochirurgical, neurosurgical, transplantation or other surgery," the regional concept of bed care is described.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.
