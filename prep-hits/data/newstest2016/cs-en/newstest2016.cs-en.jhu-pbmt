In an emergency call, the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During the calls to the emergency line to his voice Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend, and it is necessary to come to their home.
Lamb had said that his "sweet dog" house was alive and probably upset, and that the dead woman's family contacts can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on a white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy, and she is the only one who ever loved me," said the letter, which was signed by Lamb, according to authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, drove 300 miles on a school campus, where police believe he shot the popular professor Ethan Schmidt in the doorway of his office.
The police chief in Delta State University Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
Lamb said he made the fateful phone call to emergency line shortly thereafter.
Then came another death; Lamb took his own life, when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorities are still trying to figure out what was Lamb's motivation.
The details disclosed by investigators on the side of the state and the students and staff who knew him, and together they created the image of a talented, but probably a troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared the academic life.
They both taught at the faculty of social sciences and history, along with the other 17 members of the faculty and many students attended courses for both at the same time.
At the same time, there have been inclination regarding the problems.
A student who praised the Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he, too, seemed agitated and trembling, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he is faced with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 / 15.
Lamb has previously called for the Delta State University for time off for health reasons, which stated that he has a problem.
And this year, only two online courses taught.
The recent changes to university recruitment meant that a doctorate in which Lamb worked hard, he would not guarantee automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said that he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr Lamb seems to be worried about something."
To answer these questions, we have Lamb.
After he left the campus, the police picked up his trail, he crossed the border state of Arkansas back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb jedinýmvýstřelem killed himself with a pistol in the courtyard of a house about a mile from their parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, the coroner confirmed the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
Left the car running on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to the house, although Johnson said she probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009, and taught geography and hours of training.
In the spring has a doctorate in education.
One of the longtime friends Lamb described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carl Hairston stated that she was 15 and Lamb, 20, when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older boy who tutored her for several years playing the guitar.
At the time it was quite a heartbreaker.
The heart of all the girls softened as soon as he appeared, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were reportedly went for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but the record of the marriage never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which is adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O 'Steen, said he broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and they had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely exhausted," said O 'Steen about his daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
The 'Steen said he had met with Lamb, but through his daughter, Abigail, knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, together with Abigail vystuopovali at a summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played together random gigy.
The 'Steen said that his daughter writes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The julep Room, a dimly lighted bar near Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweat, what Lamb played guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We fooled around and recorded each other on a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, killed by a professor, he led a seminar in the first year and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boyish student club and student government.
The Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the consultation events with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff vigílie Schnidt also attended, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Their feet for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story has been amended to reflect the fact that the police now claims that Lamb made a phone call to an emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb Prentiss called his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.

Michael J. Fox was joking about his' date 'with Princess Diana
The Prime Minister of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
Was remarkable, even for personal reasons.

The UN chief says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's urgent military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of almost five years of conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
Once again, the UN chief urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent council countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the edge of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the Council and the division between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation intractable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity that they showed in the achievement of the Iranian nuclear agreement in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 polling numbers, which show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to describe him as a man who often change their minds.
Others over the City as a bad joke.
And some of them are preparing for the implosion.
But whether some Republicans trying to download Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead to double figures, and some people are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the prospects of the real estate magnate.
Of course, it is still only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, the Rick Perry made their way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, neither of them did not win a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could run in the general election.
But outside groups such as the Super PAC Jeb Bush and economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's willingness to stand and begin to interpret their dollars on the table in order to overthrow him.
Here are some of the recent numbers of votes, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's evaluation příznivosti has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid June, Monmouth University poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of the real estate magnate.
In the middle of July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now has six out of 10 Republicans a positive view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are in the early stages of holding.
Quinnipiac University after the vote, which took place last week, found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Donald Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC poll, which was conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Donald Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said that they were "outraged" of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent of people said they were "excited" against the 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "disturbed" if the frontrunner Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Mr. Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide, is inclined to the idea that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's vote, ABC News / Washington Post.
The same number is held in the senator's club in Iowa, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he has the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When he puts on his učenecké hats, Republican voters think Trump is a viable candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump would be the best option, according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week.
This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters in the past, did not have the clearest crystal ball.
By this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of a candidacy against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Nevertheless, it appears that a number of GOP voters see Trump as a credible campaign.
Though the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars argue that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trumpovská support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But from the beginning of September, Monmouth University survey shows that in a hypothetical contest between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always majority support.
Carly Fiorinou leads by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally, Rand Paul, John Kasichem, Chris Christie by 33 points in each.
He is in a race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the trader on the broad 19 points in a hypothetical game one against one.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters argue that he has already made his point of view.
A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday showed that more than half of voters supporting Trump says that he will not change his mind.
It is clear that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they would never change their minds.
46 percent of the states that they leave the way open for change among the candidates.
Still, Mr. Trump is the strongest opponent of his outsider colleague, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who consider their minds in the final, if they were twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agrees with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Not since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech, immigration still holds as a principal and a central topic of conversation for the year 2016.
Some worry that Trump's bombast draw key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and the damage to the efforts of a re-branding.
But according to a new poll on Monday, ABC / Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration will remain in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain.
Frustration of the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive roughly half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their state of outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new vote on Monday night, ABC / Post says they want a political outsider, rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
The State House supported a greater share of the fees for coal.
Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
The House of Representatives in the first reading, supported the government's amendments to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue from lignite opencast mining royalties from the mining company.
The Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that it will receive the extra money as the Treasury and municipal budgets.
The draft was criticized members of the opposition, who fear that the mining companies will no longer be willing to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly to the state government supported rozpočtu.Sněmovna at first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which among other things means that the state should receive a greater share of the revenue from the fees from lignite opencast mining from the mining company.
Share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also alters the method of calculating the remuneration for the minerals, which the company earns.
The change in the fees for the extraction of minerals has brought to the treasury of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
At the municipal revenue is to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee should be higher.
In the year before the municipalities received from fees of around 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
From brown coal mining communities was about 200 million crowns and the state of 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in payments from the mining space with a production of 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to fully belong to municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) Members said that thanks to the municipality will receive a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer determine the law, but it provides the government with its regulation.
The remuneration is calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for different types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the change, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
Member of the ODS Marek Benda but warned that the fee imposed by the government may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the minister, in this case, however, is not a tax because the state charged mineral, which is state property.
The fees they receive only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining will get three quarters of the money, and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be even in the case of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state in fees from mining selects, will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the mining or to ensure the Mine Rescue Service.
The draft were criticised by opposition MPs who claimed in particular that will damage the municipalities affected by the extraction of the region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to seek one of the poorest regions in order to improve the budget, the minister of finance," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
Prior to the increase in unemployment in the Reform Party MP warned Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject, Kucera wanted to return the government to work out.
In the explanatory memorandum says that according to the mining companies, the increase in fees would not be reflected in the price of coal, because the prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted over the long term.
Major consumers such as power plants or power plants would not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this increases the risk that the mining organisations will increase payments to compensate for efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which would essentially mean a reduction in the number of employees," says the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment viable.
According to the rapporteur to novel Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial to MPs before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated energy concepts and, most importantly, the government's decision to cap coal mining.
If the coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he said.
Mládkem Urban does not agree with the fact that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
The limits on the CSA down, he says, should break for reasons of social, national, and due to the long term stability of domestic energy.
Merry will lead the Czechs as number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear in Thursday's draw baráže Davis Cup in India on the board, and this time, each of them probably hits in the game.
The captain Jaroslav Navratil plans to spread the load, given the difficult conditions on the entire quartet.
In Delhi, there is heat and high humidity, so expect a tough games that can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take this into account.
I would like to spread it according to the weather.
And depending on how it will look like, he said - in today's practice of selecting downtown kumára Khánny'm glad.
With the world's number one team and forty George Jolly counts on Friday and Sunday singles.
At number two is likely to roll back Luke Jelly and Radek Stepanek.
I would like to get involved almost everyone.
I have it all in my head, but I won't say it yet, the captain said.
More certainty in the Czech lineup should be Štěpánkova participation in Saturday's doubles.
But the question is who will stand next to an experienced deblisty, who is in the Davis Cup doubles record 18: 4.
It probably won't be happy.
There are options with Jelly, or Adam Pavláskem.
"I really don't know with whom and how it will look like," said Navratil.
Decide according to the development of singles.
Variant may be Pavlásek, with Jolly surprise in the first round of the doubles win over the Australians.
"It is a double decent," said Navratil.
Against Australia, I did it, and when I play, I'd like to perform the same feat I showed up from the second set.
"I'm glad for the experience and I would like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
Domestic singles to Yuki Bhambriho (25th in the ATP rankings), who won a challenger last week in Shanghai, where he defeated a player ranked third and fourth hundreds.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They are both players of Challengerů and our experience of the ATP Tour, but a lot of times we've seen that in Davis Cup rankings do not volunteer.
"It's current form, the weather," said Navratil.
Friday's opening singles will start at 6: 30 CEST and can stretch out because of the weather.
According to the forecast is rain, and the court is not under the roof.
Play, however, may possibly under artificial light.
It ignited, and it has some two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should give want to tap out under the lights," said Navratil.
Jeremy Corbyn will be debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, is the debut of Mr. Corbyna at PMQ very enthusiastically expected
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will have its debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time, it will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will lay the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be closely studied by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement asked for "less drama and more facts."
Also stated that he might skip a few sessions, which would leave his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of the leadership of Mr Corby, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the front pages of newspapers.
The decision by Mr Corbyna sing the national anthem to draw attention to himself
A spokesman for Mr Corbyna said he would be "stood in respectful silence" and that he sees "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of the shadow cabinet, Mr Corbyna, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two's' Newsnight 'that labouristickému leaders recommended the national anthem to sing "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in a top team of Mr Corbyna, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences at work also "harbored" following the appointment of Mr Corbyna over his position in the European Union and the government limit benefits.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party to submit amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith said, the shadow work and pensions secretary, that the party "very clearly" said government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has faced over the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Labour Party, which has promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas "from the crowd" to questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP claims that PMQ are too confrontational and to refrain from the "swift response," so sprocket trade and, instead, promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQ when they attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
Also refrained from the idea that he would let the other colleagues to speakers from time to time for him, because he has said that the matter was discussed with the House spokesman John Bercowem.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said that he wanted to depart from the style of the "Punch and Judy politics," which was often associated with PMQ, but several years later, he admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ was seen as a key barometer of judgement of leaders, their leadership of the House and their position among the other MP, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature of itself and far-reaching reforms are needed.

The magistrate in the decision noted that there has been a breach of the law, because they have not been complied with all the requirements of the decision.
"The territorial decision does not contain certain elements, such as the type of property, the distance from the neighboring buildings, sufficiently clearly and comprehensibly described the shape of the building, the definition of the territory of the influence of construction," he writes in his decision.
For illegal magistrate also believes that some of the grounds for the decision were issued to the original documentation, but that has changed.
For example, the opinion of the environment.

During the trip he took to the car along with a crew of three Syrian refugees who said they wanted to popovézt about half a kilometer.
At the time, according to him, it was not a crime in Hungary, said the People's newspaper.
We knew that the regulators do not affect such negotiations.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, we were arrested and taken into custody in Szeged, described the leaf.
Finally, in the cell politician spent nine hours.
The police said they had behaved correctly, but lagged communication, because they couldn't speak English well too.
Prison, however, according to him, it was lamentable.
For example, in our cell measuring about three times four meters were clustered 15 refugees from Syria.
Among them was a boy or a girl of four years.
These people were locked up there for the second day due to the language barrier, and none of them knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.
What must not do?
Ask the president of the collection chamber.

You can ask her to change the law on exekucích valid from 1 September 2015 and on other matters related to the enforced collection, or foreclosures.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers, and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and build brand IGA using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IgA retailers and suppliers, adding brands such as Dunsborough, based on an ice cream maker Simmo's tastings at IGA stores and business owners are selling discounted tickets for Australian football league to local customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the seller of food, liquor and hardware will celebrate its annual investor's strategy day.
The stakes are high, because the southern and western Australia account for almost 30 percent of the Metcash IGA business steps and generate higher turnover than Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores are enjoying a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 percent in WA, compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any event, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi, losing about 5 percent of the food market in these two countries during the 12 months since the opening of the first shops to take sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the west during the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes at a fixed price basis Metcash could cost him around $13 million in profits before tax, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, especially against Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash food sales fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will be reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by the year 2020.
Last week, a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne would be "highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it is known that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent from 2010, and earnings from food store Metcash, which adds about 1,200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 percent from 2012, which reflects the operational development of speculation, because the sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale counterattacked and invest more than $150 million a year to supplement the full price at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and helping IGA retailers equip stores again by adding the rapidly growing food and novelties from individuals.
Metcash CEO, Ian Morrice, claims that the programs to top up the prices and retrofitting shops caught momentum and hopes to get back to the basic velkoprodej profitable growth in profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise for his behaviour, rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become collateral damage in the recent fuss over his friend Nick Kyrgiose and deserves praise for his behaviour rather than criticism, says the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo, often called the "Special Ks," drew unwanted attention to themselves thanks to the affair with the infamous Kyrgiosem and Stan Wawrinkou at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualification game in Cincinnati, had to be Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated by the referee, Harrison then said: "Kyrgiosovi Wawrinka had one stretch and I had to pull him too."
While he was last seen as he smashes a rocket after it derailed the cramp can overcome Richard Gasqueta at the US Open, Kokkinakise staunchly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where they compete with Sam Grothem on location in the second singles spot behind Bernard Romicem in a Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I was thinking about it quite strongly that, in my opinion, Thanasi was dragged into the dispute a little bit," says Healy.
He destroyed his racket when he lost to a spasm in the US, but it is not the first player to be due to the frustration of itself took his anger out on his rocket. I know Thanasiho well enough, and I can say that this event will not be proud.
But he was really very good, because he was in the US exposed to very provocative circumstances about Harrison and so on, so in my opinion, deserves great credit.
He has a great team around him, he also has a great family around me, and I think he treated somewhat hard.
It is a very mature 19 year-old man, he works very hard and it fits perfectly into the team, and so on, never had a problem with the other players in the dressing room is very respected, he trains hard, he's in great shape, it is a very stable and mature young guy, and I don't think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgiose for an important game, which starts on Friday, and states that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but it supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as a long term system.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not at all the controversy that has arisen around him [Kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think Nick was rising very quickly as Federer, Murray and others point out, in the eyes of the public is growing rapidly, also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he receives, but we're trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, when he will be able to think about it, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and for himself.
The European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closing the border and detaining migrants
Following the announcement of the state of emergency on Tuesday, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia and held by those who tried to its illegal crossing to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants has piled up in the land and the Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who are stuck for an unknown period of time on the strip of land between two countries are those who are fleeing violence in their native countries, building tents and takes up residence.
But the feelings of frustration.
When the helicopter passes over them, the migrants collectively called "Open the borders!" And cursing the Hungarian police riot squad.
Some of the protest refuse food and water.
The Serbian foreign minister declared that it was "unacceptable" that the refugees were sent back from Hungary, while more and more of them are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just an indirect injury.
Over the next days will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The riots on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after a block of 28 countries to come up with a common immigration policy at the ongoing meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40 000 people seeking protection in the Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of achieving the eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, their hopes all this Junior ROTC stuff in Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions give authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up court cases dealing with asylum.
In the meantime, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to move across the country, though it is now completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News work Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness, and the entry point into the European Union for the refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other countries in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, which is a sight that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise breaches of 4 foot fence, which the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for a longer period in prison for those who illegally transferred the refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration of the Hungarian government declares state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: The illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Technically, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which is expected in the next week, but the Associated Press reporters on the edge of the heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban for domestic defense consultant, said that the authority had caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 have already caught on the territory of the state.
Through the damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly left to fix the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a skidder covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at Roszke created chaos, because the Hungarians have opened a small office in a metal container for processing and create the crush of people.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water, as long as they will not be allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Bernie Sanders has been reduced by half in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders joins her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 per cent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to be president, gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the major competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly a decision about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
CBS News poll from last month, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained a few.
Clinton retains a huge lead among women and reduces, but its lead is narrowing.
Her support among men is significantly reduced, and Sanders loses to her only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated, and now they are equal with Sanders.
Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in double digits ahead of Sanders among liberals, but now her Sanders loses only 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters in the state say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the nominee.
A quarter would have supported it with certain reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only for the candidate.
Six percent would not encourage it.
Perhaps it is no surprise that they are particularly contemporary přivrženci Clinton because of her passion.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically supported it.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same thing about the frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed by, it is time for a woman president (13 percent), and that he is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentions her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also cited the possibility of election and consensus on the issues.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidacy for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would prefer to face - a third thinks that he would not run.
When Democratic primary voters were asked who they would choose as a second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters said more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points, while Biden will run for 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; but this number dropped from 78 percent from last month.
Biden is a distant second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného, is increasing.
However, when it came to the question of greater importance of candidate, Democratic voters prefer to solve problems before a greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate does not act as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, they have good results in some of the key characteristics among primary voters of his party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and they think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent it does not have this view.
Democratic primary voters also generally sees that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological views.
With regard to all of these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continues, the majority of Democratic primary voters are satisfied with the explanation of this issue and they say that their overall view of her did not affect at all.
But among the American public, it is a different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third of it is satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were distributed in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans say that the email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, compared with 36 percent of their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
It's all about the Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Despite the fact that Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among voters on its side, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is a decrease of eight points from last month, and by 15 points since May.
Sixty two percent of registered voters don't think he is honest and trustworthy.
And, at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good marks for the leadership.
Of the six candidates tested in the honesty of the best led Biden, Carson and Bush.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters don't have an opinion on him.
Margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up with Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump in the latest survey by CBS News / New York Times
The two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey, and others are looking for support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump with an overwhelming majority, and climbed from 23% of support in the latest CBS poll conducted by Fox News before the debate last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired in the same period from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson leads across all demographic groups, and excludes Trump among Ivy League educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is a token together behind Governor Scott Walker at the gallery from 10% support fell to the current 2%.
The former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
Margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus or minus 6% and take place in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey published last week, showed that Carson has done well for himself and reached 19% support among Republicans for Trump 32% support.
The latest survey from the ABC News / Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In a rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to fire blindly at a retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning about the much publicized faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
The five members of the fraternity accused of the death of a student in the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during the přetěžovacího fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, was filed murder charges against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College fraternity Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
The police claims that he was blindfolded, he was wearing a backpack full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed while trying to get to the target over the frozen field.
Mr. Deng had finally complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity called 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before he was taken to a hospital, police said.
However, they found time to change's clothes, we'll google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, national president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, said Police Chief Chris VAGNER at the press conference.
"At the moment, members started to hide equipment and basically prefer the wellbeing of brotherhood before the life of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
Failed to revive him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report was Deng opakovatelně hit with blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families were zdevastováno due to overloading in bratrstvích and at least one student die every year due to overloading since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengovu family, in a statement.
Fraternity and its members have the responsibility and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended charges of third degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty two other members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, will also be accused of assaulting excitement and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to detain not only the interested parties, but in the event that there is an organization that has endorsed it, either officially or unofficially, we will drive them to account as well," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the national fraternity suspended its relationship with local branches.
This is the tents when the Fed raises interest rates
Growth rates will come and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy slips into recession.
We know all of this.
What we don't know is how much time it would take and how long it will take.
For the economy, in particular, offers a history of the originator of the timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets to respond.
That is the reason why the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors would not be focused on when it starts raising rates, but rather the trajectory, how long will it take to normalization.
In the game is actually more variables.
However, in the end, the members can make sure that all the fuss over an increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of an era 'of cheap money,'" he said in a note to clients, Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low, creates a seismic shock that many might be scared.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how they will react to certain areas of the economy, on the basis of historical trends:
Given what the market has experienced in the last about a month, the expected increase in rates can make the air a little unstable.
But as soon as the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend for the cessation of shares for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what happens after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market for the past 35 years, most often - about 14 percent - is going to raise rates in the relatively flat in 250 days (the average growth rate of 2.6 percent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with the average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dolla, chief equity strategist of Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate increases and the return is beginning to decrease.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but the increase in rates often help her.
The Fed is currently facing some of the conditions that still exist, and that could precipitate a recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point in the history of the Fed's rate increases.
According to Deutsche Bank was in the 118 raising rates only twice since 1950 nominal GDP growth below 4.5 percent year on year.
Despite the fact that, in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect to sustain it when it was in the third quarter to just 1.5 percent, the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this difficult economic background could be risky and could affect the question of "whether this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready to the Fed's growth for the whole year and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC would be able to approve an increase in this session, the future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study, since 1950 were all zvyšovací cycles so far in the super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP for the beginning of the recession peaks very quickly after the onset of the recovery," the report says.
On the other hand, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of these, when the Fed waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now at 74 months and still continue.
Fixed income was also volatile, because the market is expecting a rate hike and the model is somewhat similar to that experienced by the shares.
The main difference is that the impact is more pronounced in bonds than in stocks when the Fed will change the direction of policy.
For bonds, it seems that the revenue is changing direction immediately after the first cycle of increase / decrease.
At the end of the cycle of rising bond yields fall immediately, "Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in rates will cause approach yields between long- and short-dated bonds, which matches the curve.
A high yield bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still cautious about the tightening of the yield," said Kathy Jones, in his analysis, fixed income analyst firmly in the company of Schwab.
The interesting thing is that Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market, as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that conduct most of their business in the US, they win after an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt, will be worse because of the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to outperform during the three months after the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachsve analysts in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets ahead of a weak balance sheet of any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also overcome their counterparts of lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will become a major problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Beyond the purely stock games benefit consumers also thanks to the rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will last.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for the "numbing"
Takes the view that it is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals
Also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says that just cheat the Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he's not even an original idea
BBC Radio 3's "change" in the Classic FM, claims a leading MEP, piling fresh pressure on broadcasters to demonstrate that they are doing something that they don't do commercial broadcasts.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public service radio station seems to be "ohlupována" and is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word" ohlupováno "- but it seems that is changing to Classic FM," he said.
Also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December of last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be the British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I can think of, when in fact only imitate what we already have in the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC denied the charges on the grounds that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and educating the public.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3, I would on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and making music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and new works in service is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, argued the BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey, it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the production of the BBC, who came under fire for treading on the toes of the commercial competitors during the Culture, Media and Sports, and they got to a committee hearing.
Conservative MP Damian Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show, which the BBC bought from the Dutch producer Like for example Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
You can see why it is discussed on this programme as the knives and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith aBoy George as judges - was made "in a manner typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants to "find the Corporation hit from its own stables" when it's time to start an entertaining series.
However, refused to rule out ordering more future seasons of the show, The Voice or spending money taxpayers royalties to other entertainment formats.
Online sales are growing at the slowest pace since August, and guilt can be a Black Friday
For the first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
The last month has seen the lowest growth since the records began in 2000
Online sales were strengthened three years ago, thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November could be the reason for braking spending
For more than a decade has been a virtual shopping on the rise, and thanks to him, many British high streets has become a ghost town.
But experts say there are signs of stabilising the online sales, and new figures show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending in August was the lowest increase in the growth of the measurement from the beginning of the year 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say that there are signs of stabilising the online sales, and new figures show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth over the past years and you go back to the year 2000, the status quo is always rationalise over time," according to the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG index.
He explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago, when customers started to use their mobile phones to carry out purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online, and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore appear to be bottoming out.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which had been adopted from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could delay purchases before the event, which takes place the last Friday in November.
In the last year, five times more than the average shoppers turned to their computers to handle purchases and dropped several websites and retailers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which shoppers bargain again, it can retain customers from other purchases
The research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 in every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, is more than a third of sales made via the web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buying clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in the fashion stores.

So it was difficult to find good women that we would take to us.
Kingfisher announced a decline in both sales and profits in the middle of the year after the group took the costs of closing stores.
The trend of Kingfisher, which owns B & Q and Screwfix, is to open 200 new stores

Manufacturers from Asia often used for pressing přepražená seeds, which have a stronger flavour.
Oil, but will lose all of the active substance, described by Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsku, which produces organic virgin oil cold pressed.
The company also produces sesame oil and used exclusively not roasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour is our press press 8 pounds of sesame.
Mechanical pressing, raw material heats up to a maximum of 40 degrees, and that the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin.

It contains a high proportion of omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which most of all fatty acids reduce cholesterol levels.
The problems with the heart to watch on the overall amount of fat and calories.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil is 62 calories in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil is 99 calories.
In terms of the energy value of food, it is important to realize that there are a lot more natural foods with nutrients than the empty calories.
You are part of the industrially formulated products.
Therefore, it is appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts as well as sesame and hemp for nine months.
Storing in the refrigerator, still extend shelf life.
People know the old oil in particular, according to a bitter taste.
On the other hand, the problem is not a cataract at the bottom.
It is a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp is one of the so called superpotravinám and therefore hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
For this designation is the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids your body can't produce on its own and you must take them out of the food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
Scientists study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that a daily intake of the substance is inadequate.
Men in France and Greece to consume 0.6 grams, on the other hand, the Icelanders take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is appropriate to include in the diet as part of the supporting diet to boost the immune system and the healing of wounds.

People need not worry about the use of hemp oil, does not contain any psychoactive substances.
That this oil has found a way to consumers, confirms the fact that, in the company of Bohemia Oil is one of the bestselling.
It will sell 500 litres a year.
People often use one tablespoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil is not meltingly expressive, but a great boost immunity, said Daniel Vlček from kraslické company Bohemia Oil.
According to the statistics are the most passionate nation grilovačů Americans.
There is 1.4 per household grill.
All over the world, then held a variety of barbecue contests, which only confirms the success of the culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not behind.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in my life negrilovala.
The vast majority of barbecuing and then several times a year.
The barbecue to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - the ideal is to adjust the meat marinate for several hours before the heat treatment.
That oil is the most appropriate and at the same time, the barbecue leaves wholesome substances?
In general, in the process of barbecue should conserve fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oil starts at high temperatures to lose its flavour.
Healthy extra virgin oil, then comes the body of beneficial substances that otherwise we get from them in oil consumption of the dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
But it does not mean that the extra virgin olive oil in the barbecue to find their application.
Grape seed oil for the barbecue, health and beauty.
When you think of meat, experts from the firm Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsku immediately think of grape seed oil.
Beautifully complements the taste of meats and fish.
In the kitchen is characterised by the unique properties of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, because it has a high degree of combustion, to 216 ° C.
Even at such a high temperature, then, as one of the few oils stored wholesome substances, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of the grapevine oil.
Experts agree that grape seed oil is 50 times more potent than vitamin E and 20 times more potent than vitamin C.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in the fight with excess cholesterol.
In the grape oil also accepts our body important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
The consumption of oil will also help to increase our outer beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, it is used to treat acne and helps to care for dry and brittle hair.
Chefs make use of grape oil in the kitchen of the pork.
Not only is suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, such as seasoning salads, but also for the thermal treatment of dishes.
The barbecue, therefore, can be used in two ways, by marinating and grilling itself.
Marinate the meat and fish we will maintain their succulence.
When preparing the marinade must be present three components: Oil, acidity and spice.
For example, the acidity will deliver the apple vinegar and to enhance softening of meat.
The spice gives the meat's taste and oil preserves and delivers the right sharpness, says Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape seed oil is ideal for marinating directly because as one of the few oils can penetrate through the dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are ready to barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterised by the fact that there is enough to prepare meals just a few drops.
The same is true for the barbecue.
Some of the oils are for this method of absolute taboo.
This applies especially to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be warm at all.
Before the barbecue grate with oil to prevent food met Zack.
An essential part of the barbecue is also preparing the annexes.
The grilled meat and fish is virtually anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, a green salad, and many others.
The chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend Hot summer salad, for example.
You need to: • 1 pcs peaches • 1 bunch arugula • 1 cup diced cucumber • 1 cup of mixed salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of oil
In a salad bowl, add to the mixture of their own arugula salad leaves, diced cucumbers and sliced peaches in large cubes.
According to the taste of salt and opepřete, you can also flavor with minced chili and soy sauce.
Finally, apply a few drops of oil.
Salad for exceptional taste then you can sprinkle with finely sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: Not just the drugs, but also on the patient's willingness to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs care, a number of experts: A neurologist, a physiotherapist, ergoterapeuta, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultation if they decide to have a child, to care for these patients include social advice, recommendations to regulate housing, etc.
Yet all of this is not enough: The development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more actively fight with the disease, the longer it can work and does not need to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As pointed out by doctors, the passivity of freeing up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, there is evidence that regular exercise significantly delays the time when ill needs a compensatory device, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings to various myths, for example, that the disease is automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.
The site was created to give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign to give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of the patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis is twice the adage that the disease is treated early, the more the physician can make a difference.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammation stage, when the process of neuro-degeneration is not so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the chance that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the invalidizaci, explains Dr. Eva Honey from Neurological Clinic General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitative care, which most often dealt with the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
Working with the sick, according to their individual needs: To maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, alleviating swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"It is really an individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martin Kövári, chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation of the Clinic Teaching Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis does not suffer from the same disease, but each has a slightly different way.
The rehabilitation of the disease cannot be stopped, but always can alleviate her symptoms.
But the exercise also strengthens the immune status of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that you are sick, who can handle everything, and it strengthens their confidence.
"The exercise is also washed up endorphins and make you feel good," says PhD Camilla kelp from the Clinic Rehabilitation Medicine Teaching Hospital Královské Vinohrady.
By changing the physical side, we operate on the limbic system, responsible for emotions.
So we intervene directly into the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients supposedly saved, we now know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. mezzosoprano Pavel Kolar, director of the Clinic for rehabilitation and physical medicine Teaching Hospital in Motol.
The physical therapy is to remain independent for as long as possible, including work.
Physiotherapists are working with ergoterapeuty, therefore, that each person was given a compensatory tool suited to him.
Many patients also needs the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult situation.
When it comes to the life of a serious illness, the majority of people will shake it.
Experience the shock, panic, fear.
Must respond to a major burden - the loss of health.
With such agonized soul, we have to go after someone, trying to take it all on his shoulders.
"I work with them so that he finally came to the conclusion that, even with a disability can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Raspberry - Schubert of Neurological Clinic General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere would be flying Airbuses.
Air production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new planes are full of titanium or lightweight and strong composite materials that as soon as someone can produce and process.
Still, it's next to superpřesných, computerized machine tools, next to the autoclaves for shaping composites to stumble on something as mundane as the apricot pits.
In the drum, which resembles a pot of cotton candy, in a pile of stones trotting out the edges of the metal parts that had just slipped from frézovacího machines.
"No one has yet come up with anything better," says Ivan Dubský, CEO of the manufacturer of air door Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area of former Letov produced in its wake a complete doors for the Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world are the door for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is drawn up in Prague, are also travelling to the first and upper class on the upper decks of the world's largest transport aircraft, the Airbus A380.
They are here and the door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
The accuracy is the main motto.
Be cranking the keys leaves the company to adjust twice a year.
If the yellow sticker lacked a record of control, they should be in the race to explain what auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who travels regularly to check if the doors are produced according to agreed rules.
The human senses but advanced technology not yet completely replaced.
On one door to the A320 is 1500 rivets.
You must manually nýtaři shakes.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of hammers will know if it is a rivet properly shaken.
Tolerance, in which they move, is minimal.
Rivet can appear above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That is roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When it comes to control a number of trained touch.
When the controller runs a finger along a row of rivets, can tell if one is out of tolerance.
Only then picks up the exact úchylkoměr.
Flights fed before 1989 the military aircraft program L-39.
But in 1991, he made not one.
The company had to quickly find a new contract.
Then, put together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for an emergency door for the A321 model.
Courtship with Boeing were not so happy.
"We were at that time for them, a small firm that did not have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee a long term stable supply," recalls Dubský.
The door to the American manufacturers would remain closed if Letov in 1999, delivered at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry associations, the French group Latecoere.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day started negotiations with the French, says Dubský.
A year later she bought Latecoere Czech company, and with a strong company came new contracts.
In the year 2000, started assembling parts of the doors for the A320.
Three years later, the doors were added the upper decks for the A380.
In 2006, the company has built a new hall for the processing of composites for supplies for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we didn't get ourselves to these large contracts.
Maybe we do parts or small parts.
The partners want to guarantee supplies for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
Exclusive position between the suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested 1.5 billion crowns.
The company must have a quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification cards for key employees.
Without them, the company did not produce any doors to the aircraft.
To obtain the certificates that manufacturing processes are consistent with the requirements of customers, and keeping them in multiple checks, according to Dubský is worth millions of crowns.
The manufacturing processes are changing every year.
They are more accurate and more stringent.
We have doškolovat employees, be retrofitted to devices and certify the whole process again, Dubský adds.
Now the company is finalising the preparation process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing cadmium harmful to human health.
The award was received from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for the device or chemicals that are used in Prague.
People come from Boeing, will examine the concept of the entire line.
Then we give them the production.
Check out our laboratory.
One set of samples to test out alone in his lab, and then compare the results with our, approaching Dubský way is controlled by customers.
Reward is the Prague company long term exclusive contracts.
Today, with the Prague race stands or falls embraerů production.
For the A320 produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replace the Czech Latecoere is for Brazilian or European manufacturer is either impossible or very difficult.
This does not mean, however, that the door could say any price.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
This indicates how many doors will be after ten, fifty, a hundred pieces produced.
The price for a piece of still dropping to a certain limit value.
In this price formula, we need to go.
If not, we will lose business, says Dubský.
Half of the hall, where they assemble electrical cabinets for military Airbus A400 M, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, it is building a new line of riveting polorobotická and fitting doors for the upgraded model of the A320 Neo.
Riveting accelerates and more precise.
"This is a trend that is mounting in aviation is going," adds Dubský.
Sales has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that the airlines have not yet ordered 3278 pieces of the new model of the A320.
Only a few metres beside a line for a complete assembly of the door to the upper deck of the A380.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten the time of production and reduce costs.
The full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must go through the qualification tests required for the installation of certain electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is betting on further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to the Boeing should also be involved in the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the American Dreamlineru.
"It is a huge credit to the company, if they can process in addition to metal materials and composites," he says proudly Dubský.
Latecoere, however, in the Czech Republic is on the edge of the production capacity.
Letov in the area where they are located, it is not another place.
Before the entry into force of the French mothers had a company of 180 employees.
Now there are 800 and within three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as they Airbus and Boeing compete to see how many hundreds of new aircraft, the airline industry every year, may not be worried about the work.
Although the contract for several years in advance, the parent company of the Prague Latecoere was faced with the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to loan repayments in September.
Finally, Latecoere was able to communicate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, a portion of the loans in exchange for shares.
Creditors in the company the capital increase of 57.4 million euros share of 37.4 percent.
The company's debt has fallen by two thirds, about 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company has subscribed to the existing shareholders new shares at 222,9 million euros.
So in total capital raised about 280 million euros.
The whole group is benefiting from the growing production of the Airbus and Boeing, who account for 85 percent of sales.
The average growth is expected to contract by four percent a year until 2017.
In the custom book has orders for 2.6 billion euros, equivalent to four years of production.
The French media claims that Latecoere, finally, after years in the VA can breathe again.
The Czech race in its wake is significant for the group.
Contributes to the sales of the group of 16 per cent.
According to the number of employees is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MPs support a greater share of the state charges for coal.
The change in the fees for the extraction of minerals has brought to the treasury of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
At the municipal revenue is to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee should be higher.
In the year before the municipalities received from fees of around 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
From brown coal mining communities was about 200 million crowns and the state of 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in reimbursement from the mining space with the extraction of a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to fully belong to municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) Members said that thanks to the municipality will receive a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer determine the law, but it provides the government with its regulation.
The remuneration is calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for different types of minerals.
According to the government, is the reason for the change, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
Member of the ODS Marek Benda but warned that the fee imposed by the government may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the minister, in this case, however, is not a tax because the state charged mineral, which is state property.
The fees they receive only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining will get three quarters of the money, and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be even in the case of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state in fees from mining selects, will be ring-fenced.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the mining or to ensure the Mine Rescue Service.
The draft today criticised the opposition MPs who claimed in particular that will harm the municipalities affected by the extraction of the region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to seek one of the poorest regions in order to improve the budget, the minister of finance," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
Prior to the increase in unemployment in the Reform Party MP warned Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject, Kucera wanted to return the government to work out.
In the explanatory memorandum says that according to the mining companies, the increase in fees would not be reflected in the price of coal, because the prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted over the long term.
Major consumers such as power plants or power plants would not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this increases the risk that the mining organisations will increase payments to compensate for efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which would essentially mean a reduction in the number of employees," says the government.
It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment viable.
According to the rapporteur to novel Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial to MPs before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated energy concepts and, most importantly, the government's decision to cap coal mining.
If the coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he said.
Mládkem Urban does not agree with the fact that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.
The limits on the CSA down, he says, should break for reasons of social, national, and due to the long term stability of domestic energy.
The time for a decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching how the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that more than half of those who think that the Federal Reserve will make a decision now think that they will remain dormant for some time, and will retain the interest rate in the range of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because he sat years have passed since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we get to a situation where the central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and begin the process of normalisation of interest rates, "says Angel Ubide, the Head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy was doing relatively well, there has been a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state bill and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global perspective.
They warned the markets that they are prepared to increase, but the circumstances suggest that also sees a great chance against such a step.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday, 20: 00 CET.
The shooter left a message at the Delta State University
Shannon Lamb, who on Monday had shot his girlfriend in Mississippi - and later the same day as his colleague - he wrote a message in which she said that he was "sorry" the first murder and he wishes he could take it all back, revealed on Tuesday the government offices.
The police in Mississippi Gautieru stated that Lamb, a geography teacher and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning at about 10: 00
And he said that he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police to his house.
He said: "Last night I shot his wife," and also mentioned that the house is "cute dog" who "won't be bothering anybody," but he is upset.
The police demanded the names of the caller, but Lamb is introduced.
Lamb also did not explain why he fired in the house.
When the police arrived on the scene, found the body of Amy Prentiss 41leté and a handwritten note from Lamb, which said: "I'm sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she is the only person who ever loved me. "
After leaving a message, Lamb went on a 300 mile journey to the University of Delta, where he killed a teacher Ethan Schmidt's history, and then took his own life.
The dean of William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "in Mr Lamb's head is obviously something going on."
Despite Monday's announcement that Lamb reportedly believed Amy Prentiss in a romantic relationship with Schmidt government authorities have indicated that the "love triangle" there is "no evidence."
Shawn O 'Steen, who was married to Prentiss over seven years, said that she was "a great person."
The divorce was 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
19 years old daughter O 'Steen and Prentiss was the case "shaken."
The 'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, went with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," she exclaimed Knowles.
The police said that Lamb spoke on Monday with their relatives and said that "is not going to jail."
When police caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran off into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to the CV, which published on the website of the school, Lamb earned a doctorate in education at the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
The stars that have lost their magic
The actor (left), the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, he fought with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a problem with drugs and in 2008, he was arrested for drug possession.
All of these things are certainly choose their toll.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months out of the game due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While the left guard left the wound in tears and knocked him out of the game for a minimum of six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and he thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
Injuries caused by a ruthless crackdown Héctora Moreno in the 15th minute when a Shaw pushed his way into the space of the PSF.
Nine minutes was treated on the field and was also needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double fracture of the leg and is now in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day, and then further surgery in Manchester.
It is terrible - the boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very hard, but he's playing fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
He wept.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture of the leg will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I believe that he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Mexican referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for themselves whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly surgery with both feet.
A tweet from the account Shaw says: "Thank you to everyone for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my path to recovery starts now and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United have Luke Shaw's injury in the defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recovery in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Coke, coach of PSV, said: "It was a very nasty wound."
If any player leaving the field with such injuries, everyone is very sad.
It is never objective of our players to injure opponents.
Moreno had suffered a broken leg during a struggle for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the World Cup 2014.
"It is very difficult for him, because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of the injury, it's not good," said Coke.
I was not able to see this moment.
I just saw the ball, which was headed in the other direction, so it looked like he touched him [Moreno], but I haven't seen a crackdown on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how they feel, I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel very sick of it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after the surgery Chris Smallinga.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: When a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long before she learns almost by heart.
However, it may not be David Cameron.
To query the service providers of children's schedules to appoint the popular children's book, the Prime Minister chose the Lorax, fable from Dr Seuss in 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the website of the company SuperCamps and continues: "Funny, poignant, creative and with a strong content, so I like to read to their children, because it was always an image or a message that I've never seen before."
Well, except that in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the book, according to the elevator from the 2012 film, which added more characters and details to fill the brief original text.
"Thneed-Ville in the city surrounded by walls, where all of the Nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling its desire to see a real tree," is a brief content of the book, which records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that alone wasn't enough suspicious text supplied by Cameron summary reads like a movie, the Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city, walled Thneed-Ville, where all of the Nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron met with the plot books, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature devastates greedy, trees kácející industrialista Once-reading that despite the protests of the cover the Lorax, crouched, kníratého creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely that relatively few major PR task was an assistant who had never read the Lorax child 20 times in a row.
Downing Street spokesman said that the text probably came from the office of Cameron.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text provided an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of omission of England, but still holds
To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England has selected for this tour, it will be to repeat the 3-0 defeat suffered last time in a Test series, not very likely.
I also would not rule out winnings directly to guests.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and also the collective mindset is strong; you do not bear the scars of 2012, only the youthful positivity.
The ball is emerging spinner Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, even though it is unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the England team in the experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lytha is hard for me to analyse, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests cost against two good attacks in demanding conditions and simple, but the harsh reality is that the cricketers are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, around the names of Joe Root, there were no question marks, which led to the announcement, because - and I've said this before - the players are his best atribute.
A couple of other half century and Lyth could extend his series, but he was in control of their own destiny.
Let's hope that if he could get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not entirely accurate, and it doesn't surprise me; it was always a team player.
The question of how much of the time the batsman gets to show himself, it is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth had seven caps - as well as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton has won nine.
Only Compton had a chance at home and outside.
The only thing that you could gripe is that England gave the first chance in the Caribbean Jonathan Lyth Trottovi - even though he was in the best shape - but this wasted opportunity is already a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and it is the batsman, whom I consider very positively.
It's x-factor cricketer, whom we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when we get to 236 on the pitch at Trent Bridge, which was a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors were, but all of this will of course depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea that Moeen begins alongside Cook, who would receive the extra spinner while retaining the four quicks were raised, and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why he can't bat strokemaker and the shorter man has already shown that he is a wonderful cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and there is a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before his appearance in 2001.
Immediately, he made three centuries and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the opportunity to follow him, struck me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at the gross statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and I see it as a rowboat, but not a lot of spinnerů who raised their hands, and selektoři opted for youth.
There's a lot to learn on this tour.
Outside the team, it seems that England has made a few changes and their smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, batsmen from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches can be a masterstroke.
He is one of the most beautifully playing guys who will bring a wealth of experience that they have experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes as part of a tour of white-ball and bring to the team as energy, so the ruthless spark.
I've always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and just as Mahela has the intellect, which can be used.
New voices in the locker room, even though they are consistent voices saying things that have been said before, they can sometimes lighten and freshen up the atmosphere.
Collyho Durham teammate Ben Stokes got the day off, as well as Root received a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree on it, the coaches and selektoři do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as the players that depends on the results of their work.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate until 2017.
Bad David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with every passing day, even without the election of Jeremy's "It's a yes or no?" Corbyn to lead the Labour Party, or the TUC will take on Tuesday to work on the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners also have its Corbyna and Nigel Faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in a variety of crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have had enough of the British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the contracts that they wouldn't usually.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC has decided that they want it even if eroding social protection.
We can even call it a selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and the chancellor goes to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, they make a picture of a famous local monument, with or without the local dignitaries, and then return home with words to win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to nezahleděnou Britain in Europe - "don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some shortsighted ministers and officials in some of the major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor carefully balanced, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years, and he wants to leave his post before it will be bad for her, as was the case for too long continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
The Frenchman François Hollande is facing reelection or replacement in 2017.
Also his power is waning.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how to break the legs to help the selfie Britons who could better invest its energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is what they want for themselves, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful remarks style of the SNP during the referendum campaign in 2017 in Great Britain in order to speed up the process of Brexit, says a friend.
"The renegotiation solve the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value out of the negotiations."
The Europeans to their own detriment, they know how ferocious Fleet Street can be and how the oligarchs are skeptical of the EU press barons, because they were inspired by Tony Benn during the referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2: 1.
You can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, the elusive Euro-opportunist, who made his name as the EU's Brussels correspondent "straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of villains defaulting tax, foreigners hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he realized that when you are in a cage with wild gorilla, you have to throw her bananas to give you to dinner, and then also to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he said Cameron's referendové routine, since Blair accepted the principle of the EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned his card dismissal.
The press never forgave him, too.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday at Westminster in a friendly pat on the back - I told him that I must not waste time on me - seems to be in danger of accepting the strategy of boycotting Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of media engagement, not with me, but I'm sure with Andrew - Marr, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe, I'll say it nicely, evolving.
Says he would like to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the violent tendencies of UKIP and the wild shores of Tory's small Englanderismu can certainly agree on that.
The same thing, "said Hilary Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on the radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't bring himself to admit that the appointment Corbynovo abrazivního McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty, without going too far and lost his job.
Match Hillary was much more attractive.
But the fight to stay "in all circumstances" - Bennina phrase - presumably not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said colleagues and members of their private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the background of any kind, sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - a discipline report remains important in the ages of the day's television transmission and particularly in faith, swinging hotbed of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
Cameron is fair not to provide a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider supporting the Labor Party in referendové campaign for granted, as noted by McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnellovo and Corbynovo basic equivocation about EU membership - in line with the Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist history - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussions between leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences of the central nature of the doctrinal squabbles.
Just as with his equivocation on Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that it will not want to terminate the campaign JC - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their own masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - are also suspicious voters - because of the concessions of Britain, though it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed from a "weak performance by the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and also in reducing the cost of conservative governments in power, as I was reminded at Monday's launch of what was called the Security Forum of the British influence.
Experts criticise the review of electronic published by Public Health England
Statement by a government funded agency that electronic cigarettes are about 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, the researchers claim.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticism of evidence used in his report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (however).
However, the agency published a "mezníkovou" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the robustness of the data and drew attention to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the journal The Lancet last month attacked the "extremely weak base" on which the agency based its main conclusions, however.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ, disputed the claim, which was supposedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They indicate that the public might expect the agency's claims, however, which is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one of the 12 people meeting convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell states that a sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly has previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.
BAT also approved the mandate of public health in the report on sustainability, states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding, which allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for the selection of members of the panel is not available, but they contain a number of known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also claim in the paper industry funding.
Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
However, also took part in the meeting in the tobacco.
The report created in this group "eloquently admits" missing "hard evidence about the dangers of most products on most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restriction is not described in the report, however.
McKee and Capewell said that claim, however, that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing, however, said that the allegations in the BMJ has already been answered before.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long term effects.
Phe has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and also what do not appear, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative risk compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not without risk, they are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4
The former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would give their right arm "" behind hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for programs that are not recognised by another British television.
The BBC was criticised for being put on public service programmes, which is likely to follow only a handful of people in complex broadcasting times compared to his rivals "highest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the director general Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully tried to contact with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC awards and broadcast programs that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson said in the committee for communication in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you keep your license fees, which I am not sure whether they are in the medium or long term, a good idea, it should reduce the creation of at least as far as the programs that produced different or not.
Broadcast The Voice in prime time, because they want to get the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else would have aired it, is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, absurd.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be financed by bezpříspěvkově.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders, and, of course, produced on home soil.
Frankly, other channels would have given them calmly in his right hand.
I can't understand how they are public broadcasting service.
I don't think it would not in the least weaken the BBC.
Johnson, a businessman in the series, which led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that they feel guilty by overhauling ratings "due to the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed that it is the best way to ensure long term support."
His commentary on the most popular show on the BBC repeats that the former CEO of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that the BBC will sell a show like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC hýčkanější public service programmes "passes on BBC4, where the audience can be measured quite often, but its power and they can argue when they embark on their hypocritical mission justify £4BN income from royalties," but of course we do all these obscure programs that no one is watching. "
Is broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find regresivnější system about who will get the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think of 150 British pounds a year is a large sum, but for the people, for which there is a lot of 150 pounds, I would be surprised if they paid so much, because it is not so much on the BBC.
The former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its reithovskou mission in the sense of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that a small amount of production, the BBC has now been previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of the TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take as a model of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the subject of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which was aired on television only a handful, and to connect with the commercial reporters, so we could see them all online.
"Sonogenetika" or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the nematodes.
The scientists raised worms with genetically modified neural system that can control the sound waves.
Tiny nematode changes direction at a time when they are affected by the acoustic pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses are working so that they switch cells genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
The scientists said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetika that uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activates the outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California said to The Guardian that this method could one day replace the deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure, in which they are added to the patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain, for example, the method is used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes usually do not respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction will be when it is placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
How he found bubbles are amplified by ultrasonic waves, which then passes through the body of worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves operate in ion channels TRP-4, which is located in the membranes of some cells of the worms.
Thanks to the acoustic waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are associated, reported in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to be able to control nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
When she used to such modified worms ultrasound, sound waves were amplified by mikrobublinami and transferred to the worms, which actuates the modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetice, groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, has said that sonogenetika could have many advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike the lights, which must be sent to the optical fibre to the desired location in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate tissues without restrictions and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can focus on human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that his application would also found the method for the treatment of muscle cells and cells producing insulin.

The eight golden rules for life in the student house
11 years ago, I moved to the college as a disinterested boy of nineteen, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but until now I recall tense smiles of those whom I resented - and numerous, lengthy complaints on the other.
Everything I learned it can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the tracks can range from a slightly irritating running after totally appalling.
It is tempting to babble: To tell people where you're from, if you take a year off, how do you feel about Corbyna and why "I honestly love not just hate Marmite, because people, it's just yeast extract hahaha, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help the others to breathe too - ask and expression of interest.
It drives the conversation and help you to find the people you love, and you, that you didn't have fun even if your eyelashes were on fire and they could pose a fire extinguisher.
Let the people space.
The rooms of people often turn to drinking receptions, the film evenings and municipal public places, but they are also a room in which people dress up and adjusting their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about that you started to go to college and be in a relationship
High introverts are very short.
Your room should be a sanctuary, but a lot of the tracks changes to mimopokojovou walking culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to a lifelong friendship.
It can be a nightmare for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture does not allow you to say, "I love you and I want to continue our friendship, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy that I used to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: Tap.
One boy in my tracks was in the habit of that, if the doors are not locked, is invited in.
He saw a couple of things.
Your friends thanks to the baking.
Because you started going to university at the top of the baking craze, knocking on doors and performances with plate upečenými cakes seems slightly less strange, less than the "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering local delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommate will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it will end up so that your face will be assigned to the succulent surprises.
This is, of course, the fact that you are a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and the carbon probably jams that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food on college campuses is a common crime.
The theft of the chicken, of course, is a crime, but it is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check it twice with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even when they are inside the rampage.
If someone steals something, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate, who traded his milk for the dishwashing liquid to punish the thief.
Now he is in prison.
You should not make noises that distracts people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you are also known for people in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway has asked its neighbours if they could turn it down a little drum and bass, because there were three in the night and had a test in the morning.
Their answer was the amplification of music.
When he finally fell silent at 5 o'clock in the morning, let them sleep for two hours and then set up his own music, locked the door and went to his three-hour exam.
It would be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you do?
And, on the other hand, it would be terribly embarrassing if you have the wrong roommate for his future wife, slept together, broke up and they had to see each other every day, and perhaps it would also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't help - but if your sexy roommate definitely is not your future spouse, try to get at least a little talk with their weaknesses.
In the sublime moment when you realize that someone had left the keys in an unlocked room, there is a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but easy to fix.
Teach them valuable and entertaining lesson about their security by giving them something to hide - never do not destroy someone's room toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and give them the keys to the bottle of water, which is then put in the freezer - but they never leave their things on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva is looking forward to the twins in spite of an uncertain future.
Eva has had a hard time during the pregnancy with a seven Vítkem today.
His father broke up with her, and the training and education of a child was alone.
I dealt with the situation relatively quickly - I'm very much looking forward to the child, and I was looking at the positives.
The uncertainty and the fact that I will be alone with a child, I tried not to torture.
And I definitely had the hope that we're not alone for a long time, he recalls Eva today on her first pregnancy.
At the time she met on the internet in the cabin of an older Vasek, who had started to talk about movies.
Vasek Eva with Vítkem even brought him home from the hospital, but the role of my stepfather is too keen.
"For a while, then pulled out of the program," Eva described in the documentary series The Four 3 in it.
The motive of the third series of the show of Czech television is the pursuit of happiness at the second attempt.
Vitek care and financial security for families cope thanks to work part time, and a lot of help from mom and aunt's assistance.
Not even the prospect of responsibility for a child eventually nepokazily Vaškovu affection for Eva.
Finally got together around Vítkových second birthday and he now understands Vasek as his father, and also speaks to him.
Even though Vasek already has two adult daughters, fatherhood at sixty, according to your words used, and the children are also more devoted.
In addition to Vitek Leontýnka occurred just two years and ultimately the twins.
"Vasek drifted into our family so naturally, perhaps even the fact that my mother never spoke much in relationships," she thinks smiling Eva.
Few places?
At least we are close.
Twins Emma and Eli was born by caesarean section after she was diagnosed with Eva at the end of pregnancy pregnancy cholestasis.
It is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are then in excessive quantities found in the blood of pregnant women and particularly the itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus facing premature birth and death, with the mother after birth usually resolve spontaneously.
EMA and Ela to Eva's and Vaškovu happiness were born healthy, even though they were only in the 36th week.
Emičku was placed in an incubator at the intermediate department, where he works as Vaškova niece that she could take over and check in.
Elinka was larger and immediately after the transfer from the ICU to the room, I kept it on me, describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the hospital, while doctors have given our permission to release the babies, who had managed to reach the border of two pounds.
Waiting for a weight gain of children in the hospital Eva joy but it didn't.
"I was mad with longing for her husband and children," recalls the difficult moments in the postpartum period quadruple mother.
She and her husband and the signing reversu, including penicillin approach to one of the doctors.
But this has not happened and the doctors and the twins Eva was released to home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births sends CT1 on Tuesday evening at 21: 45 hours.
Quite a large family can downsize.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric dvouplotýnkou and crowded conditions.
The house did not increase, but Vasek did Eve joy it is mounted gas stoves for the preparation of food for the six people comfortable.
When the nejůř, we'll take turns on the cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially family warmth and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or the shabbiness.
At the time, we were very nice, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and sometimes crossing kutalející with babies, but at least we are all around, smiling Eva, who can find the positive in every situation.
Vaškova work lights in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
Therefore, sometimes loses to Prague's streets as a taxi driver.
In its sixty years, according to his words with the care of the finances of families and children can handle physically, but how long is it going to be?
"I realize that, given our age difference that I once I, who will support this family," says Eva bluntly when asked about the future.
She would like to go back to work, but even more it attracts the possibility of their own business.
With four children, I'm not very glamorous for the employer.
And when it comes down to it, we can share a cab with her husband, sympathetic blonde jokes.
Apple hit the juicer.
Everything they can display.
Powerful processor, a camera with higher resolution, more robust chassis or display the sense of touch, that they are in a nutshell virtues recently presented the ninth generation iPhones.
The last two will also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
The current trend of Apple is that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight has increased slightly compared to the previous iPhonům.
2 g weight difference to the detriment of the news was really negligible.
However, this is not the case for the new iPhones.
IPhonům compared to last year's 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model has risen by 14 grams, with more then 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is no surprise, last year's affair bending in the pockets of Apple greatly worried.
The news is so out of more resilient aluminum alloy 7000, which is also reflected in the weight.
But they have a much greater impact on her display.
Indeed, Apple's 3D Touch technology used in the news, thanks to which displays will recognize the power of touch.
The display was necessary to provide another layer of capacitive sensors.
Mass displays of new iPhones as compared to previous generations has increased more than double.
The smaller iPhone originally from 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
The display on the iPhone 6s is the hardest component.
Weight of only 143 grams is then achieved in this news, thanks to a treadmill, which affected most of the remaining components.
The larger model is the most difficult element of the batteries, its weight, however, compared to predecessor has not changed in any way.
Even in this case, it is the biggest increase was seen in the display.
The weight of 5.5 "iPhone 6s Plus reaches 192 grams.
How will the new technology displays practical, will not take effect until the use.
The first users will be able to test it as early as Friday 25 September, when it will be launched in selected countries selling iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
Flakes are the breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists made the discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered that traces of modern humans from different eras, including murals, remnants of the instruments, and so on and so forth.
In the 23A, which, according to the tools dated to around 30,000 years ago, but scientists have discovered but something very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.
Indeed, on the spot, they found traces of oat grains, which on the surface appears to have passed through the process of production so popular flakes today.
Today, the grains soak first, then dry, get rid of the packaging, scouring, then steamed and do flat.
Cave in Paglicci managed to discover the grains, which was apparently nahřáta or spařena, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least the telltale traces of the use of two stones in a cave.
The scientists therefore failed in its publication in the journal PNAS demonstrate that in the cave was a complete cereal production process, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence about how people could eat cereal, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and possibly warm, of course, is entirely logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensely people use cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If there is a snowflake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have overtaken agriculture roughly twenty thousand years.
The new report Transport House stations in the city of Brno.
So once again, I listened to the reports of the names of stops in a trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Ghost, Frázova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was somewhat noisier, so reports a man's voice was somewhat less comprehensible than before, when the station reported a woman's voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so in a deeper traffic noise is more recognizable than the deeper male voice.
Although DPMB argues that this announcer chose the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but it certainly picked up from the studio recordings made in total silence, which, of course, so were quite different than the noise of the bus engine.
I live in Brno for quite a few decades, so I know the names of all those zastávkek by heart, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere, who are not in Brno, and for which these reports are primarily intended, they may be confused and may be in the final, where they arrived by mistake, then claim that the station that they had to speak, was not reported at all.
Perhaps he should announce the selection - but better anchor again - to do it again, and this time, tinged with normal traffic noise and the rumble of the engine, in which the bleating of the speaker is almost lost in the bus.
We didn't have to listen to the names of stations Water Heršpice, Šmírova or then Submersible vehicles in the creaking šalině, to which I am in Komárově transferred.
I assume that my old ears had worsened suddenly so much during that one day when the announcer stops changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, sir.
From the traťováka.
Today, many people don't know what kind of government by the biggest and brightest were called comprehensive background checks.
I took the liberty to reminisce.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office at the time when he heard on the radio, that is just seven hours.
"You're lucky you hit with Comrade Chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that's not in the mood," the dispatcher said, while I was writing in a log.
Thanks, I'll watch out.
Tell me that I'm going to districts to revise the minor mechanization.
It doesn't work, there are checks today.
They are all scared of it, the horror.
What is going on?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher.
The next time you will be, too.
I ran out into the hall.
Then the door opened and appeared náčelnikárny chief.
Stiff, with a straight face, in an impeccably tailored uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said reverently and quickly zipped the two buttons jacket uniforms.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, and I realized the cold, ominous tone that old replied.
"You're messing with," she greeted me an engineer Eva, an elderly lady, which I appreciated.
He was also the chief even before her comrades were deposed.
There are checks and you get barely.
How many times have I asked what are the comprehensive background checks, but no one really wants to talk about it.
They tend to be once every three years, they have all of them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
Apparently, however, I see.
I pulled out of the drawer file with periodic reports and then the phone.
"This Holcman, come to me now," said the chief's voice.
What poisons?
Now we met and nothing... "I murmured, but no one answered, each with just your thoughts.
"Good morning, sir, I came to your command," I omeldoval, when I entered the náčelnikárny.
The chief was sitting behind his desk and looked at a clipboard.
"Comrade mechanizátore," he said, without looking up, still studying that paper, "I don't like your behavior."
He threw the paper on the table, leaned back in his chair and stared at me like usual, unpleasant, evil, beady eyes.
I hesitated.
What's going on?
Just yesterday, the deputy said that over the last few months in office, I worked very well and he is very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad at the break.
And now this?
You realize that you're the technician track distance and according to this, you have to act.
A greeting, what did you use this morning, is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that I use a greeting from my childhood that I was brought up that way and I don't see anything wrong with it.
The chief, it was like a red rag to the turkey.
"You are a socialist rail and the only acceptable greeting is an honor," said beleaguered chief.
And besides, you still reaching out to his superiors.
Once you say "sir" and "comrade" again for the second time.
But I am not a chief for you, but the chief comrade.
Deputies are comrades deputies, Principal Chief traťmistři traťmistři are comrades!
It in your mind!
Excuse me, sir, sir, but... but I greet you a normal civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong... and the honour of a job, or a comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"This is not your preference, you're not in the side," the chief said coldly, who had calmed down a little.
Still, however, will be talking about it.
Anyway, remember that the chair at the top you have a prepaid retirement.
It was not good.
When the chief told somebody that something is not his priority, it didn't look good with that.
He glared at me for a while with a cold, piercing eyes and I was looking for the words to respond.
I am also annoyed that his haughty friendship.
It was only a few years older and playing God, actually soudruhaboha.
Jovial, arrogant, authoritarian, arrogant, as he could use at the moment.
Him all vykali.
Well, it is the chief.
Actually, not all of them, the chairman of partisan organizations like all straníkům him, but also nestraníkům, formally.
But the chief addressed many, especially those who are able to exercise their superiority.
Wiped me right now for a complete bullshit.
I thought about my ass, and it cost me quite an effort to shoot him in the face.
But I didn't return to the road to the pickaxes, let alone to keep track of doing.
What would I feed my two kids?
And the pristine house!
It made me want to cry, but I controlled myself.
I won't give him the satisfaction.
"That's all for now, you can go," said the chief audience and began exploring the paper, which had been in his hands.
At 11: 30, call me.
Everyone in the office were already there, and the question of what, and how, they said, yeah, that would be good.
Only Pecos Bill said tartly, as was his wont, he can't get rid of all of us, because they would have to do the job comrade chief alone with his faithful, and that she was safe.
The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what the old me in the morning.
The náčelnikárně was a nice reunion.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at a long conference table other comrades who had to decide on my way of existence or nonexistence.
Personnel manager, chairman of the ROH, a reporter from personnel officer for specific purposes, like a kontráše in the army, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the road.
A track worker, podbíjel sleepers or pitchforks thrown gravel.
But also a former prison guard.
There wasn't any fun with him at the time, said that big beast.
Tongues have claimed that the school came in the seventh grade, was not nothing, nothing.
And when the prison was canceled, ended up on the road with a pickax.
But, comrade, comrade was forged.
Chief motioned for me to sit down.
My heart sank, my throat nespolknutelná cone.
Someone read the opinion of the civic committee from a place of residence.
I come from a working class family, I'm married, two children, and so on and so forth.
So far, so good, I thought, and I breathe a little better.
Then the opinion of the street party.
This reflects the opinion of the civic committee, perhaps the same man wrote both of them.
But then it came!
Parents are longtime members of the party, refused to appear before the committee and subsequently by prověrkovou speakers, ostensibly for health reasons.
The chief looked sharply at me.
Someone noticed it and stopped reading.
Chief motioned that he has to continue.
It was just getting worse.
I was a member of the Municipal Committee of the SSM, and there I was obtained for the candidate.
Regardless of the parents who spoke from the side, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and the wedding in addition to the national committee am I was also at the church.
By the confidence I failed in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from the ranks of its candidates.
But it wasn't enough!
I had two children baptized, and even my mother when she died, I went to the funeral, even though it was a former member of the Party.
I say all this negative attitude to the role of the party.
If someone read only tapping his pencil on the desk was a tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
However, I am constantly repeated in the spirit of "commies lob - supermen, communists - supermen." What have I got myself into?
Why I prefer to stay at the smiths?
Repair switches I could even without some crappy clearances.
But now?
Track officials took his career before it had begun.
Go back to the squad?
That may not be possible, the chief definitely me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check the comrade here?" The chief issue breaking the silence on a cadre.
Well, according to a report from the previous employment.
You have it here?
Kádrovákovi apparently not twice.
The beads of sweat on the forehead, blinking nervously, as if he were reviewed.
The chief nodded eagerly and handed a piece of paper.
"Well," the chief said with a hint of conviviality, which is often used to be a harbinger of storms.
At first glance, nothing but praise, trained with honors, he graduated from Polytechnic, he worked as a locksmith aggregated, standard performed by an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But it is essential.
Where did you get that reference, comrade? "He turned again to a cadre, who felt that it kind of begins to turn against him, and that it would not be very soon, perhaps even kádrovákem.
This comrade gave it to me, at the onset.
Was enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the squad," a personnel manager.
And there are reports do not require his was, somehow, so I gave it to him in the folder.
"So, for inclusion in the technical functions of this piece of paper," the chief said dryly.
Someone blinked nervously and did not have to answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss it later," said the chief and kádrovákovi seemed relieved.
For the time being, take it.
"So what about you, comrade?" The chief turned to me again.
A first-name basis with me, so that's the end!
In the eyes of my vision, my scalding hot.
Followed by a torrent of accusations and allegations, and I knew that I was the ugliest creature in the world that does not deserve any mercy.
I was planting an incomplete report misled Comrade cadre Examiner, which I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from a cadre at the factory.
I also antisocialistický element, which at the time of the building of socialism promotes the flow of religious obscurantism, or even participate in them.
That it was a lot of things I've done, or perhaps even commit and I quietly prayed for it to end.
I didn't care.
I didn't care if I fly from the mechanizátora.
I didn't care that they take me and the pickaxe.
This is a job for the honest and decent people, not for an enemy of the people that I was in the eyes of the chief.
"That's it, sir," said the party chairman and emphatically interrupted the chief's levity.
This comrade made a mistake, a terrible mistake.
What a mistake, just stupid!
But he's already got his sentence.
Don't forget that, sir!
What could be worse for a young person than he was at the time we close the door to the side.
He opened again, he will have to prove that he's changed that, once again, is worthy of our trust.
Uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
It is so literate or parroting phrases from partisan training and meetings?
That is also why this young comrade must be given a chance from us!
A chance to prove that he has changed.
And who is to give it to him, if not just you, sir?
It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, support in its efforts to remedy.
It is your party obligation that no one will free you!
In fact, it is also party to all of us.
This comrade must see that the party did not forget about him.
That punishes not only as a good mother, but she also loves.
When the President ended, no one said a word.
No one expected such a reversal of the situation.
At least I.
"I totally agree with you, Mr. President," the chief said icily in an attempt to regain the initiative.
If you let me finish, you would have heard that I was going to such a conclusion.
All nodded, but it was up to them to see that he does not believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the independent examiner care for basic resources," I yelled when returning to the office and then I began to cry.
That's in addition to Eva's engineers were all at lunch.
She listened in silence my incoherent narrative of fresh experiences and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was finished, she asked whether I'll have a cup of coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, put the kettle on the stove and preparing cups.
In the meantime, talked about kádrováckých practices.
As one report, often full of praise, they put a man in the arm, and one in which there is any dirt, they send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was, but on the road with pickaxes and comrades from the factory did not know where to send it.
And our personnel manager?
That's just old, where what he ate or drank, and so it turned out the way it did.
"He takes it from the old," she said mischievously.
Today, he certainly won't like it.
Still, watch out for him, he is very vindictive.
And the party?
Essentially, far worse chief, not a philanthropist.
Zero from pickaxes with great power.
She started to boil water for coffee, and then an office filled with scent is filled with coffee.
I threw in a cup of sugar cube and silently stirring the hot potion.
I'm out of the woods yet.
Now I'm not thrown out and other clearances are up for three years.
In any case, the chief comrade me that today.
Out in the anthology literati ON TRATI II in publishing the Epic
The symbol of the municipality.
The pinwheel over Chlumem, after years of spinning again.
It is far from obvious, because it is located at fifteen meters high mast.
People from a wide area they call him "a fan of Chlum."
For the community with 150 inhabitants even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which acquired the natives to celebrate the reunion in 2010.
"We've applied at the time of the character and the fan, we wanted to get into character, of course, he knows everyone in the neighborhood," said Mayor George Masek.
Chlumské wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a reminder of the moment: Recalls a time when the people fought on the quality of drinking water.
The one in Chlum in recent centuries has been scarce.
In 1910, when they decided to chlumští representatives for a solution, which then suited until the mid 1980s.
In the village at the junction of Číchov Cave left seven meters deep well.
Three years later the well completed a metal structure with a pump to pump water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the church.
"The construction of the Borders, Antonin Fandorin THINKING in Moravia cargo 2 400 crowns," states a commemorative inscription on the ground floor of the mast.
The pump after a few repairs and triumphs of the windmill broke down in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, then began to write a new chapter in the fight for water: On this day in Chlum began to serve a new pipe.
Wind pump has remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
Dominating the running at this year's reunion natives.
Until 2008, the Chlumští decided to wind the bike repair again and bring up and running again.
They produce a replica of the original wheels - reduced by an average of half a metre.
The bike was fitted to the mast, the same year, however, had to be put down.
The reply, they did not choose a suitable material and the wheel could not resist the wind.
Then Chlumska dominant rested for several years dismantled under the roof.
Since June of this year, however, the wheel on a tall pole again.
On the occasion of the reunion natives community had a replica of the wheels to adjust osadila and returned him to the top of the iron tower.
But the bike draws its drinking water from the well only to spill the billabong.
And over the summer, we cut it completely, because there was very little water in the well.
It was spinning at least.
"In the autumn and then the windmill shaft from the pumps in the suction basket off again," the mayor explained Masek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where he received a windmill to the municipal character, however, is the only village of its kind in the Highlands.
A similar element in the character they have in honor of the local technical monuments such as Chvalkovicích and Green Mountain at Vyškovsku in Kuzelov Jazevčí, Partutovicích advertising or Polici of Vsetin.
No offense, but I don't know Lafatu, admitted rock Tripoli Goian.
"The fight against match I remember very well, and my goal, as all of my career," said Goian 34 years old at the pre-game press conference.
Georghe sous-titres par Binôme coached us back then, it was a shame that we lost.
I hope I score even now Sparta.
Except that this time we will not lose, "said Goian.
This is the man who has played 60 games for the Romanian representation is a key supporter of the Greek team.
As a shortstop will face raids Spartan offensive.
It comes a few thousand people, no hell, says about the Greek battle Spartan Hybs.
And partly knows what he can expect on Thursday evening.
Well known Fataie, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
At that time, I saw all of their games.
I know that this is a very good striker, therefore also went to Sparta, Goian said.
Other footballers of the Prague club by name, and then came the direct question whether he knows and David Lafatu, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and the captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with a slightly reproachful eye trained on the Czech journalist.
Baffled expression on his face marked: "Why are you asking me this?"
After a moment of silence began.
We've seen some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of sports.
He has a really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else except Fataie.
The Spartans on Goianovi knows very well.
"He has the experience of the larger clubs, you could say that holds the defense Asterasu, the organizer of the games," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav can be screamy.
Goian already has the best years behind him, but boasts a very interesting football curriculum.
At the time, interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City units, from Steauy but headed to the Italian Palermo, also played for Glasgow Rangers.
Waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, the coach says.
Sparta is a great team, regularly plays the European cups, vying for victory in the Czech league.
For me, is the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want the group to launch a good result.
As Sparta, we will try to win, said Goian.
I'm at peace with the Slovak goalie Tomas Košickým, who enjoys a lot of rivals from the Czech Republic.
I too.
But for the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, is considering entry on the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should be Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of the firm's trading in shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps that we have taken as part of the project for the time being, they are predominantly legal and administrative and do not have a material impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, CFO of Kofola.
"In connection with the transfer of a group of shareholders are considering the location of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
For the entry to the Prague Stock Exchange is completing a company prospectus, will present at the time of the Czech National Bank for approval.
Transfer of the headquarters of the holding company and related transfers of shares will be made in the form of a private transaction to participate only to existing shareholders.
In the context of this operation, no shares will be offered for public subscription or new investors.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would take place - if they decide that the company and its shareholders - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the company said.

This offer could consist of supply of shares on the stock market in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The test of objectivity of the Czech Television migrantské in reporting on the crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the main Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time, the main news programme of the Czech television broadcasts.
And how stand?
When they are at the School of Journalism to teach about how the media can manipulate reality, they can start today's broadcast of the Czech Television Events.
Migrantské crisis was devoted to about 80% of the broadcast news.
Except for the first minute, when ČT informed about the riots at the Serbian-Hungarian border and migrant attacks on police officers called euphemistically ran out of patience - threw rocks and attacked with metal bars), it was the current promigrantská propaganda - judge for themselves the names of individual stories.
The criticism of NGOs - a large space for nonprofit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees, not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Wandering refugees - THU consistently uses the words a refugee or a fugitive and not a migrant.
What is striking is mainly that ČT in illustrative footage used consistently only images of young children and women.
While alone in the same broadcast stated that the migrants apprehended in the Czech Republic is 80% of men.
Summary: For the most part of the propaganda, which is unprecedented from communist agitek.
I have to say that, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed for colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to build a concrete apartment, I soon ceased to be the sole inhabitant.
The Formica bathroom silverfish moved in with me.
Domestic silverfish, insects with incomplete metamorphosis, i.e., the transition from neprodělávající caterpillars on the bug and the cub looks like an adult, but it is tiny and gradually grows.
I was disgusting, and I took the opportunity to kill them.
First by hand, and later even chemically.
Socialist drugstore at their disposal to provide a sort of blue crystals.
I think it was called Zyklon B.
Or some other way?
However, it is successfully demolished.
Later, I handled it with the pharaohs alike.
A box with a juvenalizátorem, who brought the ants in the nest, and then he would not allow the Queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, the insects became the subject of my admiration and I'm increasingly inclined to think that they have the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from my life experience that the interference in the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace the other.
True in fleas and bugs would not exacerbate your karma by killing them.
In the new residence with his partner, we agreed that if we are not roaches crawling on his neck to calm eating crisps renegade skin, some of these invisible eyelashes and so on.
Their tranquil existence over time, disrupted the spider.
It was a common type of pokoutníka, who dwelt on the ceiling in the long term.
We had to live with the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased the comfort.
Because he lived with us for a few years, we found that feeds mainly rybenkami and that their numbers seem to maintain the numerical state transportation.
Confidential regular contact with each of the need, we found that it was a female.
We were witnessing a romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller, how carefully plays on strands of, not to be eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days, when moved, and did not respond to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl, where romance is happening, we are next to the females later found the remains of dried male.
Then, the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the amount of small spiders hanging elsewhere in its surroundings.
Soon disappeared.
They were eaten by my mother, partly scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she went away or passed away, we don't know, but after a month of two, appeared on the ceiling.
True, slightly smaller, probably the daughter of the praobyvatelky toilet.
From the ceiling for some time carefully observing our behaviour and shifting under the toilet bowl evaluate our aggression as a friendship.
The numbers somewhat multiplied rybenek decreased again, and the spider stared at their normal activities to ensure the food.
The whole year, our ecosystem change.
Our daughter between the reached the age where the use of pot has been a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but the eternal spilling its contents they hated us.
We encouraged her still more forcefully to use the toilet.
Daughter, however, she found an excuse to maintain his habit in the spider, which when wiping saw very well.
Our talk about seeing a spider, happiness in the house have not at all.
Crying and screaming to enforce its pot.
Was necessary.
There was a moment when he had a spider, in the interest of the evolutionary shift of daughters.
It left to me.
He was captured in a jar and banished over the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I was saying goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt awful after so long coexistence, as if I was throwing a relative.
We assumed that the roaches start to appear more often, and they'll multiply exponentially.
Wonder of wonders, a week or two, there is no.
I started to speculate on the cause.
I was wondering if there is a spider on the model of ants somehow acknowledged that the environment is not as favourable for their existence, as we thought.
But then came the first pieces of medium size, and never came back.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their link to the spider had to be caused by the fact that when they see him, he is hidden in a different place and that they are in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had a telepathic connection with his predator and its rapid disappearance triggered a bewildering response in them.
All the more so that no illusions about their vision.
Some light shyness showed, but that it would respond to wave their hands or sudden movements, it isn't.
Daughter goes to the bathroom on a regular basis.
I think I forgot to the pot.
We only have to attract a spider again.
I've got their wish on the air, and I hope that never gave up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we would have to use the Zyklon B.
The Ten utterances of Albert Einstein, which enrich the world.
A brilliant scientist of the last century, mankind probably never cease to fascinate.
He was able to dive into everything so deep that it was always a figment of astonishing findings.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
First came to people's awareness of their special and general theory of relativity, which best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
Nor can we overlook his clarification fotoefektu or the idea of quantization of electromagnetic fields.
There is no doubt that the mere knowledge deskripce and the popular theory of relativity for many is so convoluted that to elect to get a closer look rather easy comparisons.
However, it is not easy.
However, it would not be Albert Einstein, even if not for this brilliantly simplified form of explanation: An hour in the vicinity of your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven, it seems an hour - and that is relativity.
I took the liberty of his whole variety of famous quotes to choose these ten, which literally mesmerized me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, the genius is trying to do.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
The first one, I'm not so sure.
No amount of experimentation can never prove that I was right.
However, the only time he can prove that I was wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to split the atom than to destroy prejudices.
If there is a mess on the table reflects the disarray in the mind, then what reflects an empty desk?
I don't know what we'll be fighting in the Third World War, but it will be in the fourth with sticks and stones.
There are a thousand ways to kill time, but there is no way to resurrect him.
Few know is dangerous and know a lot too.
If I had an hour to tackle the problem, which would save my life, I would have spent 40 minutes of his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and his solution for 5 minutes.
The hardest thing in the world to the understanding of the income tax.
Finally, I can't forgive myself not to declare the definition of Einstein's formula for success: If we take A for success, the formula: A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y and Z rest is to keep your mouth shut.
The new and modern.
Hospital in the Zlín region are changes for $1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that the whole of this year, all four are in the black," said Governor Stanislav Misak contentedly.
The total profit of regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million crowns.
The shares are mostly higher reimbursement from insurance companies, which are equally beneficial even for this year.
This really shows that after the poor years, hospitals can finally afford greater investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Shepperton, thanks to close to the edifice, which together will cost nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
A long period when we are buying more equipment, is over.
Now we have to begin to build new buildings, because without them, you can't do peak health, justify the district deputy for health plans, Petr Nečas.
The changes are in all hospitals.
Clients come to the hospitals for next year.
Vsetín now choose the supplier of a new internal pavilion for nearly 300 million crowns.
In Kroměříž they have planned extension of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to open the central pavilion this year to build a medical ward for roughly $200 million.
And long overdue zlínskou Baťovu hospital waiting for the construction of a new central income and internal medicine, which will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is a crucial and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, it is an extremely important step," she said, for example, to build a hospital director Vera Prousková vsetínské medical ward.
Five stories tall, there has to be ready in about two years and offer comfort equipment for medical and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and the intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which will see significantly more patients, will affect all regions.
The new building will replace those in which, for example, there are many sick people in one room, on the floor, they have to be just one bathroom, the beds are nepolohovatelné, leaking windows and the medics do not have adequate conditions for the job.
"For example, our internal was built 35 years ago and is now on the edge of his life," he pointed out while the hospital director Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years it will replace-storey modern building connected with the emergency income.
Physicians and patients will be in one place all of the emergency department, in addition to the new spaces.
The same model is already half finished Uherske Hradiste.
Central intake is already, and within three years will be added to the ward.
"We pay for construction of the loan and partly from its own resources," explained the director Peter Brewer.
It is this hospital has its own financing can afford as the only one in the country.
He still has the highest profit and losses are not even two years ago, when the hospital should be zlínský dealt with almost dvousetmilionovou loss.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, an excellent performance, increasing revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Will see improvements and patients kroměřížské hospital.
During the ten to fifteen years will go to repairs, new equipment and reconstruction of up to half a billion crowns.
This year, it will be done repairing the station, then begin rehabilitation of dialysis, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging.

Nobody explained how I had to keep the refugees in the country, if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
The Interior Minister Milan Volráb (ČSSD), after negotiations with their European colleagues complaining that the Czech Republic is pushing other states to adopt quotas for the relocation of refugees, but they reject any discussion.
He also observes that so far no one has explained how they had allocated to keep the refugees in the Czech Republic, if they don't want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas were removed from the final text," AUTO told journalists.
More specifically, can you describe the position that you came to the interior and foreign ministers of the European Union?
We disagree with the mandatory quotas as a system that simply won't work.
We can't talk about migrants as the bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings that have some vision, going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We want to hear from colleagues, how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States, if redistribuovali.
We can't imagine it.
We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas were removed from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, registrars, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about it for a year and we say that this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
Not so long ago we had forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When it will be five hundred thousand?
And how we can keep those people on the territory?
Ninety eight per cent of all the people who pass through us, he wants to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, receive azyly for us, but the interest of the people of this wave of migration, namely from Syria and other countries, our race is close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees do not want even to us, but we are fifteen hundred people have already committed to accept.
Would it not be possible to accept them this way more?
We are committed to accept 1500 people, but with the condition.
We said: The functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even in the 1500 that comes 1100 people with whom we deal with asylum procedure.
They come to our detention facility, and we will treat them as well as to those that we picked up.
The big question, and we'll talk about it with Europe, if we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly in Hungary.
Because Europe is acting as if they are registered, they can't be detained.
That means, they come to our territory with the registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it may be that even the 1100 hold on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they again upon arrival in Germany.
If we will be able to hold them for the duration of the asylum procedure, deal with them asylum procedure.
If the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, and almost 98 percent, according to the European statistics receive international protection.
Then they get the documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up again in the target countries.
Then there is the four hundred people who will be přesídlovat.
This is the second project, which has not yet started, and there we are only in the fact that we are discussing with churches on the possibility that they could help them find employment, housing and so on.
But it is a very long haul.
You said that at a meeting of ministers in other states were not willing to discuss.
But it's not so that only the Czech Republic rejects quotas, but does not offer any joint action that would block the discussion?
And what exactly is supposed to be a joint step to you?
If the Federal Republic of Germany utters the incentive that all migrants from Syria can get to them, so the message is spreading in the hours after all the camps around Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages the next wave of migration, which seeks to Germany, because they just don't want to us.
We think that the journey is the protection of external borders - just to discourage the waves of migration, to help those in need, and to decouple economic migrants.
Clearly to let them know that they have a chance.
Only in the last year to Germany came fifty thousand Kosovars.
From the safety of Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of the state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's office.
If we were able to separate them and accept them or take them only according to the needs of the economy, it would be fifty percent of what they are today, social systems in vain, could go to the refugees.
Compared to the first day, when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic.
It is now eighty, on the first day it was twelve.
Where it is possible to be tightened border controls?
We were afraid of in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers that we manage.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in the detention facilities.
Of course, all of the people that we hold, we will be back within seven days of Austria.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who these people are, with Hungary, it is complicated and the Greeks - that is a completely pointless story.
So where is the tipping point?
It would have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days, we will run out of capacity, so much so that contingency plans will succeed.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister, he would immediately called an emergency government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in telephone contact several times a day.
If the situation arose, the de facto government can sit immediately and one resolution would have decided to reinforce the army, the police, the customs administration, say, or the prison service.
The extreme option is the state of emergency, which in some places now declared Hungary?
I think it can't happen to us this far.
Please note that our position is different, we are the national state within Europe's Schengen border only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to disseminate the information.
All of the information that we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, it indicates that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then imply a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, hardly at all.
Slavia paid at the last minute, a large portion of the debt.
They are trying to prevent the bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid debts.
Their money, and footballers.
Football Slavia appeared on Tuesday for the first time due to the insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after her for roughly 20 million crowns filed the company Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
Attorney Susan Mládková Slavie tried to Judge Michael Wenzlovou within a few hours to convince them that the Slavií does not have to declare bankruptcy.
And it must be said, of the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week before, the new owner of Slavie became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and the Czech billionaire George Šimáně.
Obviously, since the new owners of the money into the club, and at the last minute.
This shows the expression of Slavie before Tuesday's hearing - vršovický club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, he owed tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was between September 11 and September 15, paid," said attorney Slavie Mládková.
Slavia who paid?
The current and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovak exreprezentantovi Milan Ivan or the Czech záložníkovi Maria Ličkovi.
Slavia also paid the fee agent Alexander Losenickemu.
On Friday, the club have already paid the fees owed the city of Prague 10.
As part of the bankruptcy proceedings remain de facto only claims that Slavie disputes.
According to the club, either the liabilities incurred at all, or they are leading litigation.
However, we are prepared in the event of failure to pay the amount of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in a bank account, which we can demonstrate the statement of account," she told the judge lawyer Mládková.
"Everything that was past due, it is paid," said Mládková and added that not only are unpaid or disputed liabilities.
It is also clear that, in the next few days, the judge decides and management will continue.
Match has three weeks to submit a detailed evidence that actually paid the debts.
Subsequently, there will be an evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the continuation of negotiations on November 3.
The decision, however, she will not fall at this meeting, but only in writing for him.

Bianca was built so that they didn't fall.
But it would cost about half a billion more, says an expert from the firm that was designing the tunnel.
Bianca could lead even safer, says an expert.
Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there are two drops of soil in the Prague park, says the director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.
He said that on Wednesday afternoon during a press tour of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would have been about half a billion crowns more expensive.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a compromise between price and safety.
"The tunnel was lead safer, but the costs are growing exponentially," said Butovič.
The conditions in the park were the same to him all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where they began to forge a safer and more cautious method.
"If the measures were used about 500 metres before the tunnel would have been about half a billion more expensive," said Butovič.
Blanka Tunnel dropped three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, there was a crater in the park, in 2010, the land fell at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the company Metrostav George Bělohlava tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, said repairs.
According to the original intent of the building had become a 17 billion crowns.
When you add the VAT, which popped up twice for the duration of construction, you have 21 from 17 billion.
Add technology, land and engineering, indexation and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is no longer from the 37 again so far, said Bělohlav
That anyone ordered and paid for it.

FedEx profits mixed, reducing the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in annual profit forecasts due to low demand for freight services and higher costs for land division.
The company also said that it plans to hire over the holidays about 55,000 seasonal workers.
The same period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Shares in the company fell by about 2.5 percent in trading předtržním 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which means a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
Reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will take effect on January 4, and higher bonuses for the inland transport of heavy or large packages, which start in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "showed a solid performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rivalská UPS has stated that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 workers in addition, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is about 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, which is smaller than the $2.44. Per share, which was predicted 12 analysts interviewees Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in recent years priority international shipping, which caused that revenue in its Express unit stagnated.
But the boom in online shopping has strengthened the results of FedEx ground troops.
In the last quarter of the inland revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and their own insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while profit fell in the cargo business due to higher prices for the workforce.
In předtržním trading about an hour before the opening FedEx's shares have fallen by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
Ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
At its hottest meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week established at 27 feet long Honduran mahogany table, and they will decide whether the time has come for almost ten years to raise a key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the depictions of the central bank, a conference room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has a double charge of Congress: To maximize American jobs and keep the prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: Financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, on whether the US economy is ready to launch at the start of the unprecedented stimulus in the form of a near-zero short-term interest rate in place since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid growth in the economy, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could no longer cautious Fed scare for adding to volatility by increasing its benchmark federal funds rate - even for nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think just looking for an excuse to raise rates, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides sufficient justification to wait any longer," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed does, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Blomberg predicted an increase in rates this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed will delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
That would have pointed to the decline in the stock market, in the event that the Fed will raise rates only if politicians make the promise that a further increase is in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that the Fed policymakers hold rates steady this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed raised rates now," states.
If the Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to the limit in its mission statement and hold hands in financial markets, forfeited to panic."
Other experts argued that the increase in rates would reassure the financial markets, because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed will proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Fed is on track to raise rates by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that during the spring and early summer is expected to raise rates this year, despite complaints from liberals that there is a need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has experienced strong growth this year.
The unemployment rate has dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And even if inflation continues to take place under the central bank's 2% target, the Fed policymakers argue that the main reason was a temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world began to struggle at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record high value in May, as investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy dragged down global growth.
The market rebounded slightly this month, and the Dow is now only nearly 10% from the peak in May.
The Fed's policymakers unsettled situation in the market adds a complex calculus, when to start raising interest rates.
"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets, and reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data on which they can rely on the latest developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically should not be included in their decision making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority around the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere suggestion of the then Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed would "taper" its monetary expansion in the market, triggered spasms all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are still closely linked, it can be expected that Fed officials are watching the developments elsewhere, but also consults with other central bankers and experts in order to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated with movements in the financial markets, which appear to be inconsistent with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for an increase in rates, citing the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over the three sessions "despite limited identifiable impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.
The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during the Great Depression, such as the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam Posen, a former member of the committee setting rates at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil is not even close to that level, he said.
"You don't want to be in a situation of fear of growth rates, because the markets are angry," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be at the top.

The speed on motorways will remain the same.
The acceleration of 150 km / h, the House rejected.
On selected sections of motorway will not be possible to increase the speed limit on favourable terms up to 150 km / h.
On Tuesday, the House decided that when he agreed to the amendment of the Senate, which refused to increase the speed.
The amendments to the law on the road now heads to the president.
At the end of April, President Miloš Zeman has already said he would veto a law allowing the 90-mile speed.
The increase was also the Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (YES), according to which the Czech motorway network at such speed is not yet built.
Ťok on Tuesday before MPs supported the Senate version of the bill.
Approved the amendment will allow now in line with the government's proposal for an increase in speed from 90 to 110 miles per hour on selected roads first class, especially čtyřproudých.
The House initially extended this option on the highway, where it could be driven in selected areas at speeds of up to 150 km / h, but the Senate rejected it.
MPs now agreed to his proposal.
Senators with the consent of the Minister of Transport of the amendments also remove the traffic police permission to have the last word in the local roads, caring community.
The Senate version, which was approved by the House, also counts to sanitation, water or public lighting cables can be stored lengthwise beneath the surface of the road.
It would save for the land purchase.

Municipalities will be able to exclude freight transit through its territory after the second and third class roads under the threat of fines for forwarding companies.
The amendment also eliminates the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of the paper, which will then be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
Ústecký exprimátor goes before the court.
The overpriced baby shower threatens him for 10 years.
The case relates to the allegedly overpriced project turnabout baby shower.
Police wanted to prosecute in this case and Mrs Susan Kailovou (ČSSD), the Chamber of Deputies, but it didn't.
According to the legal characterisation of the case threatens the two to ten years in prison.
The trial is still scheduled for two days in October.
According to prosecutor Mandík with "big guy" have caused damage to at least one million crowns, stems from the prosecution.
The applicant is based on expert opinion.
Former members of the leadership of the city, according to the applicant, by virtue of their functions wrongly allowed to obtain the benefit of the company that organised the baby shower.
Mandík according to the prosecution, the chief of the department of urban services, education and culture to address in the competition five interconnected firms.
When the Challenge is another company that offered the lowest price, the city canceled the contest.
Then, the city had a contract with the administrator and the competition has only Darothore company, which then contract to the city council.
The city paid off at least a million more.
The allegations led to ensure Darothore award for the company to host the event turnabout baby shower in Ústí nad Labem in the long term and coordinated at least acted contrary to the requirement of the process with diligence, the prosecutor said.
At the same time, they are, according to him, they were aware that the company Darothore following the acquisition of the contract will be charged Ústí nad Labem turnabout for the implementation of the action baby shower prize, which will be compared to the real value of the services actually provided disproportionately inflated.
In three years, according to the file, the company behind the project collected more than five million crowns.
The city eventually paid off just one part, roughly 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid, according to an expert report by at least a million crowns overpriced.
Mandík has previously denied any breach of the law.
I did not commit any crime, I am innocent.
I don't understand this artificial case, said before the former mayor of the city under his leadership is based on a similar project in recent years.
In the years 2008 to 2010, the event ensured the Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," added Mandík.
Criminologists also originally wanted to accuse Mrs Kailovou, who was also a member of the city council.
The Chamber of Deputies, but not to prosecute.
Criminologists, therefore, in her case, the case was postponed, but counted to accuse Kailovou after the end of her parliamentary mandate.
The baby shower was a social events that took place several times a year.
When her mother received a cheque for five thousand crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police officers allegedly released a refugee dog.
Then they made journalists to delete the record.
The Hungarian police are said to be on the border with Serbia briefly detained AP cameraman and made him delete the record on which a police dog allegedly knocked down a fugitive.
But the Hungarian government disputes the accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday evening, when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filming migrants through a corn field near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
The police acted against the refugees, and one of them had a Syrian attack dog with a basket on his snout.
The dog of a man who shouted, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," he says Muz.
That Muz's filming everything, he noticed one of the police officers and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist then I couldn't even make a phone call to his superiors and colleagues on the spot.
Police Muziho was taken to a dark place at the registration centre for refugees and asked him to show them what he has recorded.
Then ordered him to delete the record.
The men came as a result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says that he felt to be in danger, because the dogs were nearby.
The AP sent a letter of protest to the spokesman of the Hungarian Government Zoltánu Kovács.
The behaviour of police officers identified as unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover the events without risking physical violence and did not have to worry that the government will destroy the material obtained legally.
Kovacs, citing a police report questioned Muziho narration of the events.
He said that the police just wanted to show them a journalist, whether they are on some of the shots, to which they are entitled.
When they found out that they are not there, nothing forced him to delete.
"The dogs may bark - are trained to hunt odstrašovali and a little scared, but they did not attack with certainty," says Kovacs.
Unpredictable the Champions League.
A win for City would kick us, believes Juventus
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created a lot of chances, but we had the ball on his cleats for us.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said match Pellegrini, whose team cashed in a competitive match after long 636 minutes.
A finalist last season, Juventus was a mutual encounter exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league as the defending champion has a point, and with the score 2: 4 is up to 16th place.
Therefore, the turnover at the Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with before the new year with the loss of three backbones - Pirlo, Téveze and Vidal.
In Manchester is blocking Pogba, Mandžukič and Morata.
"This is so, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him, we get on a winning wave," hopes Morata.
Because while we're at it, we are among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
The result of my players deserve.
"Before our balancing goal, on the other hand, we may be able to collect at 0: 2, but Rosamaria held us," said coach Allegri goalie Buffona.
"We burned several good chances," regretted Yayu Touré, City's midfield.
We need to take out of the Champions League experience and next time to try for a better result.
Goodbye, Angela, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we go any further on the issue of immigrants, we should remember that the media frenzy around it is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So, let's stop for a moment.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of babies that are in the hands of their parents along dusty roads of an exodus.
And that raises a man - in a European man - automatically sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, you'll notice on the shots landing boats to the Greek islands, the babies on them is not so much to see!
Well, we have recently disappeared from the television pictures of ships bound for Lampedusa, refugees from the French border near Menton, with its beautiful promenade lay out thousands of young men.
In large part of young black men.
And also disappeared pictures from Calais, where they eat and black men waiting to see whether they will be able to crawl through the tunnel under the English Channel.
I guess it doesn't move.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church Eritreans have done a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of it was falseness.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, and somehow feel that it's not just unfortunate children from Syria, but also the styling - for older: Fashionably vyfešákované - young men.
Whose muscles look like they just climbed out of a gym.
The only one personal experience.
This summer, the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Regardless, it was a private, came to the beach at the same time a large group of cars.
But no ham.
And the young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years ago.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes in hand, of course, smartphones.
It is a private beach, is interested, and employees - the Turks, Muslims! - they are clearly worried.
Occupy all the couches.
Who was on it, and he was in the sea, he was out of luck.
They were dressed as the American rapperského film.
Wearing a hat with a fingernail, white and coloured Adidas shoes on his feet.
Then besieged the local beach bar and began to feast.
Occupied tables around, stuffed with brown and white guests seated next to the bar - read Muslims and Europeans, without asking.
Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere.
Incoming Indians drank beer straight from třetinek - both in the series from the US?! - on the beach throwing empty bottles around him.
Constantly shouting loudly at each other.
However, it was not in English.
Then they began to drink wine, straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - in the water screaming and shouting, mothers with children and pensioners ran away, and for half an hour he was on the beach or in the pool, neither nečerný guest.
All disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff are afraid even to talk about them.
The waiter told me in the evening: "Did you see that gold, what they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, it certainly did not have a job," said the waiter.
I thought: "I know, they all had a massive gold chains around their necks.
And one wore a six-inch or so massive cross of gold.
And the women were like jewelry store.
"They are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw how they're drinking," the waiter said.
Drugs nepašují, or not.
Smuggle you something completely different.
So for me it was clear what they were smuggling.
However, in June, 2105, it still wasn't so important to me.
I had no idea what will happen next.
But the secret services and senior politicians should know it first.
It seems to me that they didn't know.
In Europe, at the time, about 1.5 million immigrants.
And they come and they go and go.
Today, it turned out that the European Union's main problem is that it's totalitarian-political-correct politicians, intellectuals and linked them to lobbying and economically important groups have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly acknowledged the main force in Europe - they lie, lie and lie - but not only them, as well as EU leaders and television, including ours.
For example, the recent television images of an enthusiastic welcoming refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow television images from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sluníčkářů at the station, but mainly - staroněmečtí - Muslims welcomed their brethren.
The long weeks squealed in reports on Czech television, how they are, according to some research, almost all of the Germans for the arrival of emigrants.
However, who was only a few days in Germany, he knows that it is a lie.
Which confirm more information.
For example, the famous poll organized ARD - Czech Association of public television companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD wanted a week ago, more than 50% of Germans to accept more refugees.
It also meldovaly our TV.
They have withheld, however, what's the next day in Germany: That the anketním vote to the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans want no more immigrants - 67 000 people took part in the survey.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "Our efforts to use multi-use very sophisticated society has failed completely."
Then she said: "Germany gives up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All the efforts of such coexistence completely failed."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, according to her failed strategy that people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side, without having to integrate. They live here with us today, and we've been deluding ourselves for a while, that will one day disappear again.
But that is not the reality.
Multicultural approach, when we say that just live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.
Completely failed.
But even Merkel probably does not have the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, the MP for the SPD, the only one who allegedly held doesn't even have a high school diploma - yes, that is the one in the EU parliament, Berlusconi said that he could play a guard in a concentration camp by the minute - as demonstrated again.
It seems, especially in the wake of the recent statements by German politicians that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that except for some, most European politicians does not support these statements, leaders of countries that were victims of Nazism, they are horrified.
What happened with the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who tried for years to, at least outwardly, to deal with his terrible past the aggressor and killer of millions?
They are right, those who say that the devil in the soul of Germany is seeded aggression, superiority and violence?
He was right, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, with all your might stop Velkoněmců attempts to dominate the entire centre of Europe?
When he said that the idea of the Great German Germany?
I had.
When it was impounded, she began preparing for the First World War.
The idea of Velkoněmecka, who led the Germans and Europe into two wars, which cost millions of lives, is likely to come back in a different form.
After the attempt by the Marxists to dominate the state, for example, with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, for example, in Germany, on the basis of ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main philosophical doctrine of Nazism, she began to develop a new German ideology.
We told the Pollyanna.
The German elite has long prevented the emergence of German nationalism, and then left alone all the fighters against the atom, enthusiasts looking for a paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our les must live.
To satisfy the restless young people all over the world, they want to do something different and better, fully opted on the side of the fighters against the warming of the planet, nuclear power plants, etc.
And forget that in this stream is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so to speak - and antislovanský propalestinský stream of treating all Slavs in the difficult thing - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the parents of a Jew, he was mostly a German nationalist.
And also, as shown by recent statements by Schulz and German ministerial openly threatening responses rebellious eastern states, the idea vůdcovského Germany.
To be to listen without argument.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when the mix that immigrants are very suggestible group of voters, we have what we have.
And, as always, is behind this capital, especially the German, who is comfortable and who could benefit from the fact that Germany and the European Union over the bank actually controls most of the nations of Europe.
Pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduced the Germans to the swamps ekologismu and multiklturalismu and brought them home today and maybe even bring millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the voices of the sirens, early on the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and they begin to revolt.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors again force can once again part of its inhabitants - but it seems increasingly smaller part - poblouznit ideologically, but eventually it catches up with the reality, as always.
Germany will burn again?
Muslim hostels already burning.
What does the German government and the German public protests against the incoming Islamists?
Who will come to help Muslims living in Germany for a long time, but certainly not asimilovaní to take over the local customs and laws?
What does the German government when it came to blows naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans fear the Islamisation of their country?
What it will do to the Germans, and even with Germany to pick up people who are loudly and publicly to protest against the new euro-Superman Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which has caused in Europe by promoting sluníčkářské ideology, which is elitist and essentially totalitarian ideology, and their greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the omission of recalcitrant democratic Germans and all the underprivileged and rebellious eastern neighbours can't turn out well.
Completion tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of pushy vendors: To scare them to death.
Just knock and robust knocker, lashes out at you in a way that the weaker nature of the need not just to stand.

Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet during breastfeeding
Brazilian pharmaceutical company SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to mediate women knowledge about the importance of a good diet during breastfeeding, using images of children suckling from the breasts painted depictions of junk food.
Human breast milk is made up of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that deliver infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the plethora of energy requirements is recommended to pregnant women and fledgling mothers to increase daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys suggest that the increased calorie intake is not the only diet that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterlandem, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic creation of their children and protect them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, he also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affect the child's immune system.
The Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's attempts to take the lead in the Today Show
Running Stefanovice Karl and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the cost of the consequences of the liberal leadership has failed to create sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
The morning show Nine screened from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott.
With rival Sunrise host David Koch and Samantha Armytage is stuck in London as part of a week long series of international television, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It didn't seem to the tyranny of distance Aussie TV viewers care so much, because the averages recorded 397 million viewers in the five capital cities compared with 330 000 viewers broadcast Today.
The Today has recorded a smaller increase in its evaluation compared with Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was up for last Thursday (343 000).
The Today fills a gap in the last few months on Sunrise.
In August, the Today was an average of 318 000 compared with 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has, on average, 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened in the morning.
The winds of change affects more than just the parliament this morning, my friends!

The big news for Seven was a stunning debut of 800 words with former packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.

Three in the finals, agrees that the Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will choose?
Secret revealed?...

The woman's "Bachelor Sam Wood comes on, is shrouded in an insurmountable mystery.

But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before were only two, inadvertently been jolting us, who's going to win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut in Thursday's finale
All three women lyrically praised, why Wood is a perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, on the question of "when, not if, he will get that Wood's final flower?," the answer could act as a spoiler about who gets the heart's "Bachelor.
How Jeavons-Fellows, so Markoski quickly appoint Mackay as the one that would be best for them to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared from one day an easy relationship.
"From the moment I stepped into the house and watched the power of Sarah and Sam, I felt that they are very compatible and still think that even during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.

Jarryd Hayne has had several options where to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams with default after his brilliant start training at the end of last year.

Four people were killed after police fired rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four year old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd of protesters against the proposal for a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, notes that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw rocks and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used tear gas and fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, states.
It was immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill, but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused by the high number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution, and mitigate their political influence.
Other demonstrations were also reported in western Nepal ethnic group of Tharus, which calls for the creation of their own state.
From August 10, were killed in violent encounters at least 40 people, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution insist since 2008, but lawmakers expedited the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted this week in Kathmandu on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials stated that the new charter would have to be taken until Sunday.
Now, we must not panic.
After the loss of the ice master Litvinova you couldn't even domestic duel with hockey players of Sparta (3: 5).
You have no fears of a similarly disastrous entry into the league as a year ago?
I hope that nothing like this happens again.

For moderately obese diabetics could be useful for weight loss surgery
The benefits of weight loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether the moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving nonsurgical treatment.
"The mortality data take a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new JAMA study of surgery.
Operations for weight loss surgery bariatrické use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reducing hunger and the limitations of the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatrické operation proved effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was carried out on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the relationship of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the values of between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher is overweight people and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, the researchers used the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study from 2007, which deals with two types of bariatrické surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy The - in medical treatments of type 3 diabetes in people who were moderately obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery, according to a study has fallen from 31% to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, BMI were those who did not receive surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly equal to the value of 29.
Among patients with diabetes was resolved completely operations at 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the medication group was treated for diabetes resolved completely compared with only 1 percent, and only partly in about 2 percent of patients.
It also was the control of blood pressure, trigylceridů and "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
It is best to maintain haemoglobin A1c below 7 percent, the researchers stated.
After surgery, the average value of the haemoglobin A1c has dropped from about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
The group treated with medication, however, this value has remained at about 8 percent.
But the better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in the higher levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year of the bypass group lost more weight compared with the group gastrectomy The (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studies of the stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to prolong life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College or Medicine - Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study were obese people who underwent bariatric surgery, about 29 percent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared with a group who tried to more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here, this work is critical, because it indicates that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI," without an increase in the risk of death or kidney disease, says.
Blackstone also claims that the people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after a decline in the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we are waiting too long with the people expressing the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once the accumulation of these genetic changes that tightly integrate their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the road back is already really heavy.
"It is impossible that they all came to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama has addressed the question of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He claimed that under the current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
Also pointed out that the response of Western European countries, whether it was in any way admirable, the refugee crisis has been inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible that all come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in resolving the crisis, stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"Take care of a few thousand refugees is beautiful, but in the meantime, you have to think about the long term solution to bring real peace and real development, particularly through the education of these Muslim countries," he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama has also commented on the actions of George Bush after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack, and claims that "a violent reaction from the US triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know that his motives were good, but he used the strength and created unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.
A fourfold increase in the number of children who ingested sanitation agent for the last four years
Poison centres around the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12, which swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the poison center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the poison center in Georgia, the number of ingestion of sanitation funds for children up to 12 years, which have been reported to poison control centers, increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children are more likely to receive these products, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children that need to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation device intentionally, while some want to impress your friends, or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show the teen drinking sanitation device due to cheap fuss.
Teenagers are allegedly mixed sanitation device with a mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scent of the device.
"Children do not think about it, that it might hurt them," said Lopez.
Many more attractive (sanitation funds) are the ones that are parfémovány.
Sanitation facilities are available with the scent of strawberries, grapefruit and oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Sanitation device contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Particularly in young children can mean a few sips of alcohol poisoning.
"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," he told Fox 4 in Kansas City, medical director of the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
A glass of whisky, you wouldn't just leave, too, but people will leave these sanitation devices out there, and when they were children, it is a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six year old girl who recently ate at school to four swigs sanitation agents with the scent of strawberries and was rushed to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered drunkenness in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritcheyho, an emergency doctor who cared for her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah pronounced slurred words and was not able to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitor her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl because of alcohol, she fell and hit her head, the Ritchey.
"It was very scary," she told CNN Ortoria Scott, mother Nhaijah.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use soft products or arrange for sanitation facilities were out of reach of children.
Outside of alcohol poisoning, some sanitation facilities were associated with death.
In 2013, two women died from Ontario after swallowing the sanitation device, which contained toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The medics believed that the product contains methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth grade in northern New York were planning to poison their "bad" teachers by deploying antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation facilities and prohibit their presence in the room.
The police foiled the plan as "innocent chitchat," and referred to the discipline of the school district.

Why I witnessed executions in Oklahoma.
Later today, despite the legal intervention, I will follow the death of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't come to that, I will be sitting in the viewing gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary death chamber and see Richard Glossipa, which will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who will be witnessing his death.
First, I received an invitation in January over his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day is coming, I'm starting to get worried.
Why am I doing it?
I accepted the invitation, because I think it is a good way to be able to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
I would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because it is often more applications than vacancies, morbid lottery, which will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, it will monitor the entire execution.
I can't do that.
I will sit alongside Richard Glossipa's closest friends and I have formed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one of two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
Often we laugh when we talk.
Prison administration claims that I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed notebook and I will not be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, I'm compromising their impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he'd like it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could formulate better," but I still think that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if it did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him that I can at any time remove from the list of witnesses.
But he wants the international journalists, who will be at the ready to tell a story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help practices against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want more information about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts that I've created.
I'm not going to repeat again all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is innocent of murder.
I definitely believe that it has not provided sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is bad.
And it is from this perspective, I will follow his death.
I can't say that I'm really objective.
To that end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me, is the experience of what it is to see the man I love die unnecessary deaths.
The man escaped from the Canning River after a police chase
Constable Canning Vale remained dry after he rescued a man from the Canning River.
A man from Petrhu, fleeing the police, came after he got into a shallow muddy water just metres from a police officer who tried to gently persuade him to come back to shore.
The police were called in from Canning Vale incident beyond the Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, trying to get rid of them unikem Canning across the river.
But he didn't get far.
"He was in the water, and he said 'I'm not going out, just come and get me'," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec just wanted to soak your uniform, I tried to use safer tactics and that police negotiations. "
"Sometimes people are trying to do funny things during the escape," said Castledine.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove the car into a ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the river Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but inspired by locals to start planning for the biathlon Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody says that the organisers tried to spy on him and threatening to close factories
Peter Moody has accused Racing Victoria stewards that he tried to get a spy into the barn last year and threatened to immediately put an end to the racing.
He focused on the organisers and the integrity of the Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratch Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which for him on Wednesday was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media he was always trying to do what is best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation in terms of Lidarin positive swab to cobalt, which can explain.
He bit his tongue on charges of spying for 18 months and did not want it to look like a "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about the fact that I sat on it for a long time, but I just feel so frustrated that it comes out of you all at once," said Moody.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Today, I'm going to go home and I'll sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up and to think that I'm doing the best for them.
When you start to think the opposite, then it shouldn't be a coach.
I would have to consider what to do after their licences.
Moody released earlier in his interview for the racing.com bomb that the integrity department tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call on the issue - and offered him a job in my stables to find out information about the things that are in my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a crook.
If that is so, they should show all your information, because they failed in an attempt to catch me completely.
Robert Roulston, a former chairman of NI, David Moodie, the current chairman of the NI, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of NI, which at the time were aware of, and are aware of that even today.
I should think that it becomes a personal matter?
She keeps the NI grow some balls and arrange for people outside of the coaching position taken responsibility for what is happening in the industry?
I'm bad for this industry?
I'm really so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe I need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I say now will provide them with the material to ponder.
But I got to the point when it doesn't matter to me, and I'm sad about it.
I'm really sad.
I'll push them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go away.
The coach's frustration levels increase with long term investigations for cobalt, including Lidari and recent scratches made him feel that he could "hours of your license on the table."
Mood, best known for designing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, described the rule of treatment on race day as "ridiculous" after he was injected the horses up clay tiles or mud, which is against the rules.
It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my team accidentally smeared mud on his leg.
It could be the last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three month disqualification for the treatment of tiles on the day of the race, which the organisers have already opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
The people who create these rules, doesn't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.

Bellamy added that this situation has increased his confidence, because his team is criticized by two senior coaches, which may mean that they are afraid of defeat from the Storm.
"It still comes - I don't remember Trent Robinson talked about wrestling, when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed in the last year none of our defensive system and techniques, the last few weeks we've only emphasized contact during the crackdown, and that was the turning point for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously a great team coaches, so it is probably not used to losing, which could be a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetovův team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about the exciting football.
He was right in his Saturday game was as exciting as ours, it was just as exciting, "Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George were criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he could care less.
But now he has a team that can play the style of game that feels exciting, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
You want to play the kind of football, if you have access to this type of players.
He said this view in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play his style of football teams - but not every team has two linebackers such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play the style.
It makes me more confidence, because they say such things because they are worried about the game against us.
Six weeks ago, probably wouldn't even think about us, when they get to the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the Storm and Roosters have fallen more wickets than in a game the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos team game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game is over 20-18, in our game, there were two more attempts, but it is an exciting football?
Or are they break and neskórování experiments that interesting?
To me, it's the agenda.
If you mention us, it means that at some stage we will meet again.
The Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park, tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man received $200,000 bail on drug charges
The man, who had faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, which was smuggled out of Queensland, received $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of the five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drugs from the yacht Solay, who arrived from South America through Vanuatu and in August, docked in Coomer.
Maksimovic was spotted at a meeting with the accused in the dock together during the morning and later met them at the cafe Coomer Road, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Even though he was facing a potential life sentence for possession of cocaine commercial quality, defence lawyer Maksimovice built on the fact that there is no evidence that he owned the quantity and that could be quite by chance in a cafe and innocently.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan thought that Maksimovic had fled.
Has a clear connection to Serbia.
Often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
The Crown case he lied to the police about where he lived.
The mother and stepfather Maksimovice jointly offered $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both parties, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their effort itself was manifestly inadequate, because the accused failed to appear in court, he warned.
Maksimovicovi was granted bail on condition that he surrenders both Australian and Serbian passport, will report to the police every day and will adhere to a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the phone girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
Paedophile used phone eleven girls to get pictures of the abuse of children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept, then volunteered to her on her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photographs of children, sent to him by another user.
The girl is then woke up and found that her phone is missing and then found him in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
She's been through it, and before his mother pointed out, found disturbing news.
The police became involved and saw five photographs, then the computer analysis found the address and found "disturbing" searches on the Web using search terms for indecent images of children.
Hogg after the officers claimed that the reason was "to guide paedophiles" on the Internet before they "pretended to be a police officer and scare them."
The fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson stated for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said that it is an addiction - that it is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he performed searches on the computer, but claims that he only wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them
Claims that he was drunk and said he wants to see the pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added: "When the girl found messages on her phone, he called his mother, shaking and crying.
Saw naughty pictures on his phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and PlayStation to talk with girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a resident of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to bringing an action for adopting or providing inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, violated the conditions of his bail on 25 January and failed to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg has not been placed on the sex offenders list, because he can argue that his crime was "no significant sexual overtones."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael set sentencing for October due to the reports of social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but he was held in custody ahead of a hearing on the other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders list before the date of the judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gave a speech in Parliament,
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, earlier this year, he fell on the stairs leading to the podium.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind the injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilshere, it is still only September and, if his rehab goes according to plan, there is no reason for him to play again on Christmas.
The best case scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship, is clearly uncertain.
Too bad this nnejnovějšího problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury, and then got back into the former forms during předsezóny.
"This type of injury does not threaten a career," says Wenger.
It is a wound that requires treatment.
It is not about nothing special.
It was just an accident.
Not even his ankle injury, which he suffered before.
That might be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury, whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
A survey conducted by the Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different injuries Wilshera since six years ago, he had his game debut.
Over the last five years, he played in only 65 league games arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 was one of two clubs in the Premier League, who lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of the recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you're coming back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and to win the competition," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope that his body stabilizes, I'm sure he does, and will have the career they deserve.
Campaign begins with Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches on Saturday, with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, it means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to emerge.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudem instead of Nacho Monreala Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and let the players who need it, to breathe," said Wenger.
Even if Arsenal is the clear favourite to progress from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo also been defeated in a total of 41 games after last season to keep the campaign "unbeatable."
The stadium on Wednesday night earthquake shook 3.2 degrees Richter.
It was in Zagreb for the tenth time this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco, and he remains a distant hope to lead the club to a first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is huge," said Wenger.
Arsenal it never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: Comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The lack of a similar view in different show is striking, especially given how men are needed to open up more desperate than ever in terms of suicides among young men in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 years in Great Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, identified the Campaign Against Living matter (CALM) 2015 as the Year of the Man, whose aim is to challenge a culture that prevents men to seek help if necessary.
At the heart of this fight is the friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that, in the event that the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "good mood," their chances of recovery has doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends half a chance on the incidence of mental health problems.
But the friendship to work, of course, must be achieved as soon as possible.
In this communication via social media, with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the communication, the immediate response is often preferred a meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, health, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are in reality rather isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call the external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as recently explained one billionaire and creator of games, money really can't buy greater happiness.
The beauty of the show Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters was not defined by their work, but their personalities that shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, while watching football on the comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stems from the knowledge that, yes, men can also identify with it, although I usually keep your feelings to yourself.
As a kindly worker explained to me:... "my role as an audience of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies, I really confirmed that even the smallest friendly interaction can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about the problems.
Friends are one of the programs that arise in my mind when I'm trying to offer a longer term compensation mechanism.
Highlights the small moments in the male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider on the phone to help people in moments of despair, but long term support must come from a closer look, from a network of friends and family.
Therefore, if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend hosted by Comedy Central station, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely rewritten to celebrate.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know what a difference it can make your friendship.
Television show "Friends" will be broadcast on Comedy Central Station from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG to sweep Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidim and Edinsonem Cavanim after plant gates against Malmu.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League and helped PSG on Tuesday to beat the Swedish team Malmo.
Here is a report on the game and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint Germain started its journey in the Champions League final comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmu at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and the PSG player sent the French champions to victory, but then threw a few chances, and finally upped their lead when Cavani scored the goal in the 61st minute head.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the team Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because the focus not only on qualification to the elimination rounds, but to improve their trips to the quarterfinals, which recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even when they got the three points, it was not a classic performance of the team of Laurent Blanc and Zlatan was put in front of the gate of the prodigal and later was replaced against his home team and the club where he started his storied career in 1999.
"The Champions League is not easy to win out or at home, so a win 2-0 makes our adversaries problems and look comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things that we have to improve with the passage of the season," said Blanc.
That is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we have won, but I regret that we nevstřelili for one or two more wickets.
Put back after injury as one of three changes to the team of PSG, who took home this weekend draw 2-2 with Bordeaux in the League 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing has been identified as the man who moves PSG in Europe to a new level since his move from Manchester United, which took place last month, and he showed why, when he ran to pass Marco Verrattiho for defending Malm and a beautiful finish behind Johan Wilanda sent the ball into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected that it will kick off a spectacular victory of PSG, had to be disappointed.
Malmo, which beat Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, came with 9 International in the starting lineup and five defenders and two closed reservists were a tough opponent.
But in addition to the missiles Nikola Djurdjice, who only just missed the far corner of the goal of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, it didn't offer much in attack.
Instead, PSG were stripping themselves for the benefit of the poor přihrávkami and miserable endings, which was not good either from Ibrahimovice, who couldn't even shot five times in the first half, and then was disappointed because his shot into the net arrived shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he showed a much more appropriate when it came to preparing the chances for his teammates, and it was just out of his passes, when Di Maria sent rotational missile, which ended in Wilandově goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavanimu, the Uruguayan sent the banner over the line for the sixth goal of the season after he put a pass after pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
That ended any thoughts of Malm on the possibility that they could get something from the game, and only an excellent save from a nearby Wilanda dashed the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged, even at a time when the goal of relieving Ezequiel Lavezziho unacceptable at the end of the game.
Team Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."
Since then, we've only played the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
The qualifying matches is not enough.
I take my hat off to Paris.
For them, it was a fascinating game.

As the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
Emergency flares fired by Germany nearly nestmelila European crew, but it makes the ship to change course, he wrote the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees: There will be more systematically sort of migrants and asylum seekers, as soon as he steps on the old continent - especially in Greece to argue for the future distribution of refugees according to quotas based on the quantity that is increasingly remote from reality.
Six days after the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said 25 of the 28 EU countries, in order to reallocate 160,000 refugees, changed the interior ministers of the Member States priority.
Rather than worrying about the final destination of migrants, it is first necessary to filter those who arrive today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving inside the Schengen area.
"The effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for the management of migration," stresses the text projednaném ministers in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis, the EU's common currency notes that it is in danger in his next big integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but does not lose their decisiveness and increases the pressure.
Restoring border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in this country.
Central power that makes clear that, without it, there is no freedom of movement in Europe is possible.
He served as proof that Austria and Slovakia on Monday joined on the measure.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France have been thinking about it, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has already been introduced to a long time ago.
This exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the rules of the Schengen.
That it is a domino effect, but also blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now an effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already passed into the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague, Thomas de Maizière about intensive talks during a private conversation with his three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but there is stiff.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics were already recorded and identified with taking fingerprints two thirds of newly arrived refugees.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because they fear more than others on her shoulders were camps in which the refugees massing on its behalf.
A real black hole remains Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish coast landed this year, more than 200,000 people, which is more than twice recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It is a huge, gaping hole.
Athens, which are still in the financial collapse and that they are waiting for a new government, his hands folded in his lap.
That is the starting point for the Balkan route and now a source of common concern for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Juncker's Commission promises to establish control points will occur as soon as possible, but gave no number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece, apply to the whole of Europe," they agreed on Monday, EU interior ministers to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore necessary to deploy SWAT teams in this country, the European border control agency Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to expand its capacity for the reception of asylum seekers and to strengthen the supervision of the islands.
"It will require adequate financial resources," warns the text presented to ministers for approval.
From the perspective of the law will continue to have the last word in Athens.
The question of the actual European border guards had not been officially raised, but that Europe is approaching.
The new emergency 28s anyway pushed to one side the question of mandatory quotas and 160,000 refugees who have already signalled the beginning of Juncker's Commission and the European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
Consider it as an attack on its sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, on Monday was maintained in the text approved by the majority of 28s.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already reached an agreement in June during the hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.

He believes that Liberec can even Braga to impose their style.
We have a team that is strong on the ball, at the same time, is uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
Play from the disposition of 4-4-2 with a rapid transition to the offensive phase.

We studied a lot to be sniggered at the opponent, which is very helpful, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapt to the workouts.
"And certainly we want, even if it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," added the coach.

With the decline of CK have insurance to pay claims in full.
Insurance companies should pay for the demands of clients in the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
On Wednesday, the House decided to approve the revised amendments to the law on the conditions of business in tourism.
Travel agents will be able to draft, which is headed to the Senate for consideration, to replace the insurance against the collapse of a bank guarantee.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay the demands of clients and above the agreed limit does not agree.
The Ministry for Regional Development to adjust lasts, argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end travel insurance against a collapse when the amendments will apply.
But the proposal also criticise the travel office.
Without insurance, they will have to either quit or leave the country.
Minister for Local Development Charles P. (YES) argued that the cases where insurance companies did not pay off the full refunds are not eurokomformní.
Draw attention to this year's decision by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the level of coverage.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, P. pointed out.
"We appreciate the efforts to improve consumer protection, but there must be a limit to be viable," said Vice President of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.

They are in the country but also the possibility of extending care.
For example, in the department of surgical units could arise day surgery center, where policies are implemented according to the performance of the surgical disciplines that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.

Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the emergency rooms and emergency department.
There is also the possibility of a concentration of such equipment to the hospital Island, where there is already a similar treatment.
Another inpatient capacity, which is in the Karlovy Vary region appears to be insufficient, the subsequent care beds and especially the beds in hospitals patients (LUGs), whose capacity in Nejdku is inadequate and, in particular, should be closely related to acute care beds.
