When an emergency call, the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During the call to the emergency hotline with a trembling voice professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend and need to come to their home.
Lamb resolved that his "sweet dog" house was alive and probably upset, and that contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on white bond paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could go back, I loved Amy and she is the only one who ever loved me," the letter, which according to authorities signed the Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who was teaching two online courses Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles on a school campus, where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the doorway of his office.
Chief of Police in Delta State University Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10:18 am.
Lamb apparently made a fatal call to the emergency number shortly after.
Finally came yet another death; Lamb took his own life when police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and faculty to hide behind a locked door, the authorized authorities are still trying to fathom what was the motivation of the Lamb.
Details, published by investigators from the state and the students and staff who knew him, together created the image of a talented, but probably problematic teacher.
Students confirmed that his lesson enjoyed.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself Lamba included in the book he wrote, thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared campus life.
Both taught at the faculty of social sciences and history, along with the 17 other faculty members and many students took courses in both simultaneously.
Simultaneously occurring inclination as problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if with him something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said he told Lamb that is experiencing stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb has previously called Delta State University on leave for health reasons when he said that he has some sort of problem.
And this year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes regarding recruitment universities meant that doctorate, which Lamb worked hard, he would not guarantee an automatic mandate to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said that he was unaware of any conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb apparently little worried."
On these questions we have not responded Lamb.
After he left campus, police picked up his trail when they crossed the border back into Arkansas Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb was killed jedinýmvýstřelem pistol in the yard about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the coroner Washington State Methel Johnson.
The car had kickstarted the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went into this house, although Johnson said she probably knew people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began work at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which counts about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and taught geography and hours of training.
In the spring, he earned a doctorate in education.
One longtime friends Lamba described him as smart, charismatic and witty man.
Carl Hairston said that she was 15 and Lamb 20, when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy, who had tutored several years of playing the guitar.
It was then quite a heartbreaker.
The hearts of all girls softened once appeared, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss together reportedly walked for some time.
During an emergency call Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but the record of the marriage never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which is adjacent to the river arm Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said he broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely distraught," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he met with Lamb, but by his daughter, Abigail knew Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss, he and Abigail vystuopovali Summer Festival three years ago.
They later played together random Giga.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, dimly lit bar near Gautier, he said that he last saw Lamba and Prentiss at night on September 5, sweat, what Lamb finished the guitar and harmonica for not numerous crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"He was just happy couple," he said.
We joked and recording each other on the joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, slain professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the student club boys and Government students.
In Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people including members of the faculty, staff, students and community members attended commemorations with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
In the middle school started again.
"We try to have our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The writer for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this reportage.
This story has been modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency number after killing Schmidt and although Prentiss Lamb called his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.

Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for professional Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family, when I realized that the seat next to me is empty, and I realized that there will sit Princess Diana," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins and me is that I reach something that could be called a false date with the Princess of Wales.

8 polling numbers that show that Donald Trump real light
Some have tried to mark him as a man who frequently change opinions.
Others waved their hands over a trial-over wit.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But whether some Republicans trying to download Donald Trump down from the top of the elections fail them (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump in the leadership of the two-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what it means for the nomination chances of the real estate tycoon.
Of course it is still only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that in this period of 2011, did Rick Perry lead the way for the rise of Herman Cain, ultimately neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why it could face in the general election.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeb Bush and economic conservative group Club for Growth aware of Trump's will to resist and begin to interpret their dollars to stop to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers, which suggest that real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability rating has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, showed Monmouth University poll that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view on this real estate tycoon.
In mid-July it was already 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
It now has six of the 10 Republicans favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in 10 say that they have a negative view.
And these numbers are in the early stages holds.
After Quinnipiac University poll, which took place last week found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view on the Trump.
Two-thirds of voters the GOP would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a poll by CNN / ORC, which took place last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said that they were "outraged" of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said that they were "thrilled" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters claim that they were "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the company favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans see Trump temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide favor the idea that real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's poll by ABC News / Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Caucus Iowa, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think that my personality commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think they have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independent states that his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to the ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put their scholarly hats, Republican voters think that Trump is a real contender.
Asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the best choice, according to a poll by CNN / ORC last week.
This is a change from late July, when four of the 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had in the past, the clearest crystal ball.
By the time the last cycle the 4 in 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry's candidacy as a winner against 28 percent for the eventual nomination Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a number of GOP voters Trump sees the campaign as credible.
Although Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beats just about everyone.
Some scholars argue that the fragmented field likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trumpovská support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the survey Monmouth University from the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical straight fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates almost always gets Trump majority support.
Carly Fiorina leads of 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points in each.
In dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beat him?
Ben Carson led by businessman over a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
A bare majority of the followers of Donald Trump says that he has already made his opinion.
A new survey Tuesday CBS / NYT shows that just over half of voters supporting Trump asserts that its view had not changed.
It is obvious that many things can change, and no one can really say that he never changed his mind.
46 percent say that they leave the back door open for change among the candidates.
Yet Trump present the strongest opponent of his fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion as final, would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 of 10 Republicans reportedly agrees with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his campaign speech notification to immigration still holds a major and central topic of conversation for the year 2016.
Some fear that Trump's bombast lures key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and damage efforts rebranding.
But according to a new opinion poll Monday ABC / Post, six of the 10 Republicans argue that they agree with Trump on migration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration will remain in the spotlight, Donald Trump also remains.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now receive roughly half of support from Republican voters, mainly due to their state of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new poll Monday's ABC / Post say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
Voting Des Moines Register / Bloomberg Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
Deputies supported a greater share of state taxes for coal.
Czech receives more than 400 million.
Deputies in the first reading supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue charges from the surface mining of brown coal from the mining company.
Minister Jan Mladek (CSSD) promised MPs that so as to give extra money to the Treasury and municipal budgets.
MPs criticized the draft of the opposition, who fear that the mining company did not want to patronize the village as far as they will pay higher fees directly to the state rozpočtu.Sněmovna first reading supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which among other things means that the state should receive the greater part of the proceeds of fees from surface mining of brown coal from the mining company.
The state's share will rise to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the method of calculating payments for minerals that will benefit the company.
The change in fees for mineral extraction is to bring to the Treasury 427 million more than in 2013.
On revenue of municipal budgets by the government should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
In the year before the village received a fee of roughly 450 million and the state budget 150 million crowns.
For lignite mining communities was about 200 million and the state of 66 million crowns.
The amendment also allows for an increase of payment for mining area with a mining permit at 1,000 crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these settlements has continued in full go to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mladek (CSSD) deputies said the village so as to give a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
Stumpage amount will not be determined by law, but it provides Government Decree.
Payment shall be recalculated by multiplying the quantity of mineral extracted and rates for different types of minerals.
According to the government's reason for changing inter alia, to react flexibly to the current economic situation.
ODS deputy Marek Benda but warned that government regulation determining the fee may not be consistent with the Constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek but not in this case a tax because the state is imposed on mineral which is state property.
Charges only receive municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of underground coal mining will receive three-quarters of the money the village and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state on charges of mining chooses, will be assigned.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide mine rescue.
Template criticized opposition MPs who argued in particular that will damage the municipalities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kucera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that the mining company did not want to patronize the village as far as they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions only to the Minister of Finance improved the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) selected in the Usti region.
Before the rise of unemployment in the Most KSCM MEP warned Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject the law Kucera wanted to repay the government for completion.
The explanatory report says that by the mining companies to increase taxes not reflected in coal prices, because the prices are more than 90 percent of long-term contracted.
The main consumers such as power plants or heating plants would therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining companies will increase payments to compensate for the effort to reduce its operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," admits the government.
According to her, the increase of fees in terms of employment bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment Milan Urban (CSSD), it is crucial that MPs before the law was passed knew conclusions regarding the updated energy policy and the decision of the Government of coal mining limits.
If the coal mine well beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he said.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should be made until after 2020.
Limits on CSA mine, according to him should he break because of social, national economy and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Vesely will lead the Czechs as the leader, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear in Thursday's draw barrage of Davis Cup in India on board and this time, each of them is likely to hit into the game.
The captain Jaroslav Navratil plans that due to the difficult conditions spread the burden of the whole quartet.
In Delhi, there is heat and high humidity, so expect a difficult match, which can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take into account.
I would like to spread out the weather.
And depending on how it will look, Navratil said during today's training center in the Czech selection Kumara Raja Khanna.
The team leader and the world's forty Jiri Vesely counts to Friday and Sunday singles.
At the number two position is likely to have contributed Lukas Rosol and Radek Stepanek.
I would like to be involved almost everyone.
Slowly I got it in my head, but so far it will not tell the captain said.
More confidence in the Czech report should be Štěpánkova participation in Saturday's doubles.
Only question is who will stand alongside experienced deblisty, which has in the Davis Cup doubles balance of 18: 4th
Vesely it probably will not.
That leaves the possibility of Jelly or Adam Pavláskem.
"I really do not know with whom and how it will look," said Navratil.
Decide according to developments singles.
Alternatively the Pavlásek, with a happy surprise in the first round by winning the doubles over the Australians.
"It's good to doubles," said Navratil.
Against Australia, I did it, and if I play, I'd like to show the same performance as I did from the second set proved.
"I'm glad for the experience, and I would like to bring point," said Pavlásek.
Home seeded in singles Yuki Bhambriho (125th in the ATP rankings), who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where players beat hundreds third and fourth rankings.
Number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both are players of the Challenger have our experience of the ATP Tour, but many times we have been convinced that in the Davis Cup rankings do not decide.
"Decides current form, the weather," said Navratil.
Friday's opening singles will begin at 6:30 CEST, and can be stretched because of the weather.
The forecast is rain and the court is not under the roof.
Play can, however, possibly under floodlights.
It sparked and it has some two thousand lux, which is enough.
"You should give it to finish the game under lights," said Navratil.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ very eagerly awaited
New labor leaders Jeremy Corbyn will make its debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn lay the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while its performance will probably carefully studied media and MPs.
In the weekly statement called for "less theater and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip a few sessions, which would leave their colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of leadership of Mr. Corby, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC annual congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem in service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the front pages of newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn decision to sing the national anthem attracted the attention
Mr. Corbyn spokesman said there will be "stood in respectful silence" and to recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Mr Corbyn, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that labouristickému leaders recommended the national anthem to sing "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in a top team, Mr Corbyn, cited the differences in economy, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than one sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences to work to "reap" the appointment of Mr Corbyn despite its position in the European Union and the government limit benefits.
Mr. Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers Party submit amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
A few hours later, said Mr. Smith, secretary of the shadow Work and Pensions that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, he faced David Cameron over the past decade since his election as Conservative leader.
Leader of the Workers' Party, which promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from the crowd" questions for Mr. Cameron and got more than 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP argues that the PMQ too confrontational and refrain how "of prompt answers," so the gear shop, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn says that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, to represent it in PMQ when they attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
Also he dropped the idea that it would allow other colleagues to for him from time to time got out because they had heard that the whole matter was discussed with the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercowem.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he has said he wants to move away from the style of politics "Punch and Judy", which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later, he admitted, he failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990 PMQ were seen as a key barometer of the judgment of the leaders, their deputies and their leadership position among the other MP, although critics have argued that became a caricature, and require far-reaching reforms.

"The present zoning does not include some essentials, such as the kind of land, distance from adjacent structures, sufficiently clearly and comprehensively described the shape of the building, defining the area affected by the construction," it said in its decision.
For illegal magistrate also considered that some of the grounds for the decision were issued initially to present documentation which, however, has changed.

IGA retailers and suppliers are added with brands such as ice-cream maker based on Dunsborough Simmo's offering tastings at stores and IGA store owners sell discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
It is expected that Metcash disclose further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the vendor food, alcohol and hardware celebrates its annual investor day strategy.
The stakes are high because the southern and western Australia represent nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate higher turnover than Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores are enjoying a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared with about 14 percent in the eastern states.
Anyway analysts like Morgan Stanley believes that the Aldi shelves at 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months from the opening of the first stores that took sales from all existing players, but most independent retailers.
This week, in its report, Morgan Stanley analyst, Tom Kierath, estimated that retail IGA could lose US $ 360 million to annual sales and Metcash $ 250 million at the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the west during the next year, and will generate sales of 500 and 600 million USD in individual markets.
The loss of sales volumes in the food and fixed price basis Metcash him could cost around US $ 13 million on income before taxes, affirmed Mr Kierath.
At the same Metcash losing market share in the eastern states, especially against Aldi and Coles, although recent survey by Roy Morgan found that shoppers at IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash food sales fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and its market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent 2020.
Last week, chief fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne would "very likely disappear within the decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglassův comment.
But it is known that board member Metcash contacted Douglass last week.
Market share IGA dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from trade food Metcash, which supplies about 1,200 retailers IGA, dropped by 43 percent from 2012, reflecting operational development changes speculation, because sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesale moved to counterattack and investing more than $ 150 million annually, so-called rack rates at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and helps retailers IGA stores refitted with the addition of the rapidly growing food and news from the freeholders.
Metcash executive director, Ian Morrice, says programs topping the price and retrofitting stores catches momentum and hopes Wholesale back to base profitable growth in profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became collateral damage in the recent fuss about her boyfriend nick kyrgios and deserve praise for their behavior rather than criticism, says the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks" on himself drew unwelcome attention because of an affair with a notorious Kyrgiosem and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, had to be in Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated arbitration, Harrison said afterwards: "Wawrinka had one stretch Kyrgiosovi and I had to stretch him too."
While he was last seen as smashing a rocket after he spiked the spasm can conquer Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis staunchly defended Healy.
The young man is currently located in Glasgow, where it competes with Sam Groth location in the second singles match for Bernard Romic in the semifinals of the Davis Cup against Britain.
"Pretty intense, I thought that my opinion was Thanasi throughout the dispute dragged a bit," says Healy.
He destroyed a racquet when he lost due to cramp in the US, but it is not the first player to be booked for the frustration of myself vented his anger on his racket. Thanasiho I know pretty well and I can say that this event will be proud.
But seriously he handled very well, because he was in the US exposed to highly provocative circumstances for Harrison, and so on, so in my opinion, deserves great recognition.
It has a great team around him, also has a great family around me and I think that they are treated rather harshly.
It's a very mature 19-year old man, works very hard and the team fits perfectly and so forth, never had a problem with other players in the dressing room is very respected, trains hard, is in amazing condition, it is very stable and mature young guy and I In short, I think it deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgiose due to an important match, starting on Friday, and states that "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed star.
"First of all we want to make our team totally focused on the game and not at all the controversy that about him [Kyrgios] form," says Healy.
And I think that Nick rising very quickly as Federer, Murray and others point out, in the eyes of the public is growing rapidly, and he made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we support it, we try to help him understand consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight, which shall be able to think, in my opinion the best solution for the team and for himself.
The migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closing borders and detains migrants
After the announcement of a state of emergency in Hungary on Tuesday closed its southern border with Serbia and detaining those who attempted to illegally crossing its best to stop the influx of migrants.
On the edge of chaos as hundreds of migrants accumulated in limbo and the Serbian authorities have responded indignantly.
Those who are stranded on an unknown period of time on the strip of land between the two countries, there are those who are fleeing violence in his native country, putting tents and settle down.
But it comes frustration.
When the planes overhead helicopter, migrants collectively call "Open the borders!" and revile Hungarian riot police unit.
Some protest refusing food and water.
Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was "unacceptable" that the refugees were sent back from Hungary, while there are still more coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not just indirect harm.
During the next few days will be discussed with Brussels and other countries, "says Ivica Dačić in Prague.
Riots in the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the bloc of 28 countries come up with a common immigration policy at the ongoing meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to the sharing of responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in stunned Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of achieving an eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which would EU nations received more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday, the EU convened a special European summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, their hopes intent in Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday a state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up court cases dealing asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania, to stop refugees trying to cross over to their country, it has now completed fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondents Charlie d'Agata reported that even prisoners have been on the list of those who helped to stretch barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary became a major weakness and the entry point into the European Union for the refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go to a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, a view that is clearly different from the other EU states, including Germany.
New laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize violations 4-meter fence, which the government was built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for longer terms in prison for those refugees illegally transferred.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration of Hungarian government declared a state of emergency," he told reporters the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we are quite clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban counselor for domestic defense, said that authorities seized 45 people who tried to cross the border and seized 15 already in the country.
Penetrated through damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offenses under the new laws.
Authorities quickly left the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also shut down two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a used trailer covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at Röszke was chaos, because the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container processing and originated throngs of people.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, while refusing food and water until they were not allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Ahead of Hillary Clinton before Bernie Sanders dropped by half in the national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is catching its advantage.
Clinton now podporuje 47 percent Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with for 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether they will want to become president, winning support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the major competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that it is clearly a decision which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more certain of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost ground among several demographic groups, while Sanders won a few.
Clinton maintains a big lead among women and moderates, but its lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has decreased significantly Sanders and her only lose 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated and now you are equal to Sanders.
Clinton still has a large lead due to older voters.
Last month, he had a double-digit lead over Clinton among liberals Sanders, but now her Sanders loses in this group only 5 points.
About half the Democratic primary voters throughout the US says he would enthusiastically supported Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would have supported her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only for the fact that the candidate.
Six percent did not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, are contemporary adherents Clinton because of her particular passion.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supported.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically supported Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about his favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When supporters of Clinton asked in an open question why they want it as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed it was time that the president of a woman (13 percent), and that is the best candidate for this to work (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also cite her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also cited strong possibility the election and consensus on the issues.
While the vice president considers potential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see in the faces - the third turn, thinks he should not run.
When Democratic primary voters were asked who would be chosen as the second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters said more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will spread out to 20 points, while Biden will stand at 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; but this number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is on this scale far second, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného increases.
However, when it came to the question of greater importance candidate, Democratic voters prefer solving problems before greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate does not act as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among primary voters of their party.
Most sees Clinton Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and they think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden from all three leads in truth, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think that Clinton honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent it does not have this view.
Democratic primary voters also generally see that Clinton Sanders and Biden are in accordance with their ideological view.
Regarding all these scales, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about the decision to Hillary Clinton about using her personal e-mail server and continue as Secretary of State, most of the Democratic primary electorate is satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of it at all affected.
But among the American public's generally a different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with the explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinions on the subject were split back in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans say the e-mail controversy has no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent is their opinion of Clinton worsened.
These are mainly Republicans, where there are more than 6 out of 10 claims that their opinion of Clinton worsened.
Even though the Clinton seen as honest and trustworthy among voters her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think that is honest and trustworthy.
And while 55 percent of registered voters across the country also sees Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested in the most honesty led Biden, Carson and Bush.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters on his mind did.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic electorate is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump in the latest poll by CBS News / New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll and let others seeking support.
Voters among Republicans across the country continue to support Trump overwhelming majority, and climbed from 23% support in the latest CBS poll carried out before the debate Fox News last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired in the same period from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups and eliminates Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor of Ohio John Kasich, is in arrears with isolated Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker entirely at the gallery from 10% support dropped to the current 2%.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was held in September.
The latest survey from CNN / ORC published last week, showed that Carson improved and reached 19% support among Republicans for Trump 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With an increasing trend Carson Trump decided to fire blindly on retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning regarding Trump's faith.
"We need the energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity were charged with the death of first-year students Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during a fraternity ritual overload in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, was filed murder charges against five people.
Members of the brotherhood of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng at the opening ceremony in September 2013 and late take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officers stated that he had been blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly molested when he tried to be objective over the frozen fields.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, police claim.
However, they found the time to change clothes Dengovy, googled his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, president of the national fraternity, and ask him for advice, said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point members started to hide equipment and basically gave priority to the welfare of fraternity life before Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to revive him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report Deng was repeatedly struck with a blunt object on the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of hazing in fraternities and at least one student die each year due to hazing since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengovu family said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members have the responsibility, and this step is an important part of the authorities.
Monroe County grand jury recommended the charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault and criminal conspiracy overloading.
"We want not only to detain the person concerned, but in case there is an organization that it has approved, whether officially or unofficially, will drive them accountable as well," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned fraternities and the national fraternity canceled its relationship with local branches.
This happens when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate hike comes a bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy slips into recession.
This is all we know.
What we do not know how much time it takes and how long it will take.
For the economy, namely history offers little originator of timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
Awareness of the Federal Reserve to raise rates is often, though not always, in determining how the economy will react and financial assets.
That is why the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on it when it starts raising rates, but rather the trajectory of how long it will take standardization.
The game is actually more variables.
However, eventually the members can reassure the market that all the fuss about the speed increase may be exaggerated.
"The Fed first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'cheap money'," he said in a note to clients Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
In contrast, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low, creating a seismic shock, which could be many to fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how they respond to certain areas of the economy, based on historical trends:
Given that the market has seen for the last about a month, the expected increase in rates to make the air a little unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend to re-block shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what happens after the Fed increase.
More specifically, the market for roughly the last 35 years most often - about 14 percent - heading to hike in relatively flat at 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average income from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis of Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published by Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on stocks tends to become more significant later in the cycle of rate hikes and the return begins to diminish.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but increasing rates often help her.
Currently, the Fed faces certain conditions that have not existed and which could hasten a recession.
Most noteworthy is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history when the Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank has been raising rates over 118 since 1950, only two nominal annual GDP growth below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expect its maintenance, while in the third quarter was only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this difficult economic backdrop could be risky and might appear question "whether this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready for the Fed's growth throughout the year and all eyes turned to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could at this meeting to approve the increase, the future trading indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, since 1950, all heightening cycles are still in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP covering the tops of the recession very quickly after the incipient recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those waiting for the Fed since the end of the last recession; record was 35 months, we are now at 74 months and is still continuing.
Fixed income was also volatile because the market expects a rate hike and the pattern is somewhat similar to what happens to stocks.
The main difference is that it is quickly evident impact on bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes the direction of policy.
For bonds, it seems that income changes direction immediately after the arrival of the first cycle of increase / decrease.
At the end of the cycle, increasing bond yields are falling away, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the rate hike will cause approach yields between long- and short-dated bonds, which parallels the curve.
High Yield Bond often in this climate work better, although "we are still cautious about stretching proceeds," said in his analysis of Kathy Jones, firmly fixed income analyst at Schwab.
It is interesting that Jones thinks the markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several indications that the market outlook accommodate tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the flatter yield curve, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that conduct the majority of their business in the US win after an increase in interest rates and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with lots of debt will fare worse because of rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt will also be larger.
"History shows that the" quality "stocks tends to overcome in the course of three months after the initial rate hike," Goldman analysts said Sachsve in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets overtaken weak balance sheet company in any interest rate increases in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their counterparts lower quality on average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a huge problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate loses most said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock play also benefits consumers due to rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3, Classic FM copies, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "dumbing down"
He considers that it is becoming increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rival
Also he focused on the BBC Music Awards and says it simply cheating the British
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and says he's not an original idea
BBC Radio 3, the "changes" in the Classic FM, says deputy premier and piled fresh pressure on broadcasters to demonstrate that they are doing something commercial broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said BBC bosses, the radio station of public service seems to be "dumbing down" and is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its business rivals.
"Radio 3 seems - I hate to use the word" dumbing down "- but it seems that changes on Classic FM," he said.
Also he focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year appears to be the British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind when actually just imitating what we already have on the market, "said Mr. Bingham.
Director General of the BBC denied the charge, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I appeared on any learned a different radio.
And their commitment to live music and creating music is in fact at the top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works into operation is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, argued Controller BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before because the British are less educated regarding classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC, who came under fire for treading on the heels of the commercial competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport, and got to hear the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show, which the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated street price of £ 22 million.
You see why this program discusses about as unoriginal and a not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith September aboy George as judges - was made "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation "found a hit of its own stables" when the next start entertaining series.
However refused to rule out ordering more future series on The Voice or spending money of taxpayers royalties to other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and may be to blame Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the smallest increase since 2000, began the actual records
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that the November Black Friday could be the reason braking spending
More than a decade was a virtual shopping on the rise, and thanks to him from many UK main streets become ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs of stabilization online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest increase in growth from the very beginning of measurement in 2000, with an increase of just 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say that there are signs of stabilization online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the past years and go back to the year 2000, always with the condition eventually rationalized," says the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor sales index IMRG.
It explains that Internet sales were strengthened three years ago, which encouraged customers to use their mobile phones for making purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online, and they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as a sofa.
But now (growth) rather stagnant, and therefore it seems to fade.
Black Friday phenomenon, which were incorporated in America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers would be able to delay purchases prior to this event, which is held the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average shoppers turned to their computers to furnish purchases and dropped while several websites vendors.
Experts believe that Black Friday, through which shoppers haggle again, can retain customers away from other purchases
Research published association British Retail Consortium found that only 1 of every £ £ 5 were sacrificed online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales made through the web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online instead of in-store fashion stores.

Manufacturers from Asia often used for pressing přepražená seeds, which have a more pronounced flavor.
But as oil lose all substances described Ladislav Hačecká, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Kraslic oil from the Sokolov region, which produces organic virgin cold-pressed oils.
The company recently produces sesame oil and seeds used exclusively roasted white sesame.
Within an hour of our press can handle compressed into 8 kilo sesame.
Mechanically pressing the feedstock is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and thus the product meets the criteria for designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, the loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is beneficial in diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
Czech favorite among oil sunflower.
The research Jarmila Hamerské, who led at Masaryk University, revealed that he prefers the warm kitchen 43% of respondents.
Frying in fact not suitable, already at 180 ° C begins přepalovat.
It is better to use it for example to flavor salads, and is particularly suitable in the diet, which helps in preventing cardiovascular diseases.

For problems with the heart's need to watch out for amounts received overall fat and calories.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil has 62 calories in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil is 99 calories.
Regarding the energy value of foods, it is important to realize that much better natural foods with nutrients than the so-called empty calories.
You are part of industrially formulated products.
It is therefore appropriate to resort to extra virgin oils.

Old oil people know in particular under bitter taste.
On the contrary, failure is not haze at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance has not been chemically treated.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Hemp seeds are among the so-called superpotravinám and therefore hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
Under this designation is due to the high content of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids the body can not produce itself and you must receive them from food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
Scientists study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that a daily intake of this substance is insufficient.

According to statistics, the nation nejvášnivějším barbecue Americans.
Per household there seems Grill 1.4.
Throughout the world, then held a variety of barbecue competitions in which only the success of the culinary discipline confirmed.
Czechs are not far behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in life negrilovala.
The vast majority of barbecues and several times a year.
For this to be successful grilling, we must not underestimate the preparation - the ideal is to regulate meat marinated for several hours before cooking.
Which oil is the most appropriate and at the same time when barbecuing leaves health-promoting substances?
Generally, in the actual process grilling should conserve fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oil starts at high temperatures lose its flavor.
A healthy extra virgin oil, then comes the body of beneficial substances from them otherwise receive when consuming oil from food prepared at lower temperatures.
It does not mean that the extra virgin oil when grilling find their application.
Grape seed oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When he says meat, experts from the company Bohemia Oil Kraslic in the Sokolov will immediately think grape seed oil.
Indeed wonderfully complements the flavor of meats and fish.
The kitchen has a unique feature enhancing the natural flavor of food.
Also suitable for frying and grilling, because it has a high degree of combustion up to 216 ° C.
Even at such a high temperature, then, as one of the few oils keeps health-promoting substances, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlcek Oil Companies Bohemia, one of the few Czech producers of oil from the vine.
Experts agree that grape seed oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
Further comprising a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in dealing with excess cholesterol.
The grape seed oil is also accepted our body essential unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Consuming grape oils also help to increase our external beauty - in fact improves skin elasticity, and is used to treat acne and helps to care for dry and brittle hair.
Chefs can use grape oil in the kitchen praised.
Not only it is suitable for preparing cold dishes, such as flavoring salads, but also for cooking food.
When grilling therefore can be used in two ways, when marinating and grilling itself.
Marinating meat and fish preserve their juiciness.
When preparing marinades must be present three components: oil, acidity and spices.
Acidity deliver, for example, apple cider vinegar and so we achieve softening meat.
Spices in turn gives the meat flavor and oil preserves and adds just the right zest, advises Daniel Vlcek.
It adds that grape seed oil for marinating is ideal because one of the few oils can penetrate through the dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are therefore ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oil is distinguished by the fact that to prepare food for them just a few drops.
The same is true for grilling.
Some oils are required for this method of preparation absolute taboo.
This concerns in particular flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not even warm.
Before grilling, brush grill with oil to prevent overcooking food.
An essential part of the barbecue is also preparing supplements.
Grilled meat and fish fits virtually anything - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light salads and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia, for example, salad oil recommended hot summer.
To him you need: • 1 piece of peach • 1 bunch arugula • 1 cup diced cucumbers • 1 cup of the mixture of lettuce leaves • 3 tablespoons grape oil
A salad bowl, add the mixture of lettuce leaves-picked arugula, diced cucumbers and large diced peach.
According to taste with salt and pepper you can also be flavored with minced chilli and soy sauce.
At the end sprinkle with a few drops of grape oil.
For exceptional taste you can sprinkle with finely chopped salad with almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: does not depend only on medicines, but also on the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis care needs of many experts: neurologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist, and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about medical care, such as women with multiple sclerosis need consultation and if they decide to have a child to care for these patients include socio counseling, referrals when adjusting housing etc.
Yet this is not enough: the development of the disease may significantly affect patient himself.
The more actively fight the disease, the longer it can work and do not fundamentally change the style of your life.
As the doctors point out, passivity ill releases space for disease activity.
It is for example shown that regular exercise significantly delays the time when the patient needs some compensation aid such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings succumb to various myths, such as that the disease is automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.
I therefore created page Give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by an ongoing media campaign Give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis paying twice saying that the disease begins to heal sooner, the more likely the doctor can make a difference.
Is it because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when it is not so strong process of neurodegeneration.
The earlier you intervene, the better the chances that we will be able to stop the disease and delay debilitating, explains Dr. Eva Honey from the Neurological Clinic of the General Teaching Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often resolves weakened lower limbs and unsteadiness.
The sick are working according to their individual needs: to keep fit, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor alleviate swallowing disorders and to improve coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says MD. Martin Kovar, senior consultant of the Department of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine University Hospital Motol.
People with MS Whilst suffering from the same disease, but that each exhibits a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can not stop the disease, but it can always relieve the symptoms.
Physical activity, however, also strengthens the immune status of the organism, which in the case of multiple sclerosis desirable.
Another positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that you are sick verify what they can do, and it strengthens their confidence.
"When you exercise endorphins are also washed out and the person after him feel good," says Dr.. Kamila racially Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine, University Hospital Vinohrady.
By influencing the physical side, we operate in the limbic system responsible for emotions.
Thus directly interfering with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients so to conserve, we now know that need targeted burdens," says prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolar, Head of Department of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine University Hospital Motol.
The aim of physiotherapy is for man to remain self-sufficient as long as possible, including employment status.
Physiotherapists, occupational therapists therefore cooperate with each person to get compensation aid tailored to him for peace.
Many patients require the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult situation.
When you come into the life of a serious illness, most people shake it.
Experience shock, panic and fear.
Must respond to the heavy burden - the loss of health.
With this aching souls we have someone go, do not try to carry everything on his own shoulders.
"I work with them so that eventually came to the conclusion that even with a disability can live a full life, and that multiple sclerosis is not the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinova - Schubertová of the Neurological Clinic of the General Teaching Hospital in Prague.
Without Prague manufacturer Latecoere flown by Airbus.
Aircraft production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of light and titanium or solid composite materials, which just so someone can not produce and process.
Still can next superpřesných, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to autoclaves for forming composites come across something so common, such as apricot seeds.
The drum, which resembles a pot on cotton candy in a pile of stones to wash away the edges of sheet metal parts that had just pulled out of the milling machine.
"So far nobody came to anything better," says Ivan Dubský, CEO manufacturer of aircraft doors Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area of Prague's Letňany produced earlier Letov complete doors for the Airbus A320.
As the only company in the world supplying doors for Brazilian Embraer 170th
Doors, part of which is drawn up in Prague, also entered into the first passenger and upper classes on the upper decks of the world's largest passenger aircraft Airbus A380.
They are installed here and the door full of new composites for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
Maybe torque wrenches leaves the company adjusted twice a year.
If, on the yellow sticker lacked an audit trail, should the Prague plant of explaining auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who runs periodically check whether the doors are manufactured according to agreed rules.
Human senses but advanced technique yet completely superseded.
On one of the doors into the A320 is 1,500 rivets.
You must manually Riveter shiver.
It takes them two days.
Even the sound of hammers hitting know if it's properly rivet shivering.
Tolerance in which they move, is minimal.
Rivets can perform above the surface plane of zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That is roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When the check comes the practiced touch.
When the controller Swipe your finger across a row of rivets, he knows when one is out of tolerance.
Until then picks up an accurate gauge.
Flight nurtured before 1989 program of military trainer aircraft L-39th
But in 1991, he has neither one.
The company had to quickly find a new job.
Then he got together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
Won the tender for the supplier of emergency doors for the A321 model.
Courtship with Boeing were not so lucky.
"We have been for them if a small company that did not have enough money to invest and not to Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supply," recalls Dubský.
Doors to American producers would remain slammed if Letov in 1999, has not delivered on the Prague conference of the International Association of French aerospace industry group Latecoere.
I spoke about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day was launched negotiations with the French, says Dubský.
A year later Latecoere Czech company and bought a powerful company received new orders.
Already in 2000, he drove the installation of the door for the A320.
Three years later added the upper deck doors for the A380.
In 2006 the company built a new plant for processing composites for the Boeing Dreamliner deliveries.
Without Latecoere we ourselves to these large orders received.
Perhaps we have made parts or small components.
Partners want guaranteed supply for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Czech Latecoere last year achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a net profit of 147 million crowns.
Exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000, has invested 1.5 billion.
The company must have quality certificates, certifications 170 special production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them the company would no door to the aircraft it produces.
Obtain certificates that the production processes meet customer requirements, and repeated inspections to keep them standing by Voyage million.
Production processes are changing every year.
They are more precise and more stringent.
We have doškolovat staff, equipment retrofitted and re-certify the entire process, he adds Dubský.
Now the company is finalizing the preparation process for plating zinc and nickel, which will replace the existing Human harmful cadmium.
Although the assignment received from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for equipment or chemicals that are used in Prague.
People come from Boeing, examines the concept of the whole line.
Then we show you the production.
Checked by our laboratory.
One set of samples to test out alone in his laboratory and then compared the results with ours, approaching Dubský way the subscribers control.
The reward is the Prague firm long-term exclusive contracts.
With Prague race today stands or falls manufacture Embraer.
A320 produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replace Czech Latecoere is Brazilian or European manufacturer either impossible or very difficult.
This does not mean, however, that a door could say any price.
The contract price curve.
That shows how much they will become one door after ten, fifty, hundred-made pieces.
Unit price still falls to a certain limit value.
To this price formula we must fit.
If not, we will lose money, says Dubský.
Half of the hall where the assembled electrical boxes for military aircraft, an Airbus A400 M is currently empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen here is building a new line polorobotická riveting and assembly of the upgraded model for the A320 Neo.
Riveting is faster and more accurate.
"This is a trend which is fitting in aviation is going," says Dubský.
Sales has secured the future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have now ordered 3,278 units of the new model A320.
Just a few meters next line created for the entire door assembly for the A380 upper deck.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten production time and reduce costs.
Full installation could begin within two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests necessary for the installation of certain electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the biggest Airbus.
The company is betting on further development of the production of composite materials.
Besides Boeing should also participate in the new program, the Airbus A350, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"For the company's enormous credit, he can do except metal materials and composites processing," he says proudly Dubský.
Latecoere However, in the Czech Republic gets on the edge manufacturing capabilities.
In the area of flight, where it is situated no more space is.
Before entering French mother company had 180 employees.
Now they have 800 in three years, there could still be a hundred more.
Until Airbus and Boeing will outstrip many hundreds of new aircraft, the airline ordered every year, may not have worried about work.
Although it has orders for several years ahead, faced the parent company of Prague Latecoere threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September installment loans.
Latecoere finally managed to arrange with its main creditors.
In late August, he exchanged a portion of the loans for shares.
Creditors acquired in company capital increase of € 57.4 million share of 37.4 percent.
The debt of the company decreased by two-thirds, ie 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
Společnost subscribed to existing shareholders new shares for 222.9 million euros.
In total raised capital by 280 million euros.
While the whole group benefited from increased production Airbus and Boeing, who are involved in sales of 85 percent.
The average growth expected to contract by four percent per year until 2017.
The book has custom orders for 2.6 billion euros, equivalent to a four-year production.
French media say Latecoere finally after many years of kapačkách can breathe again.
Czech plant in Prague's Letňany is important for the group.
The group sales contribute 16 percent.
According to the number of employees it is the largest foreign subsidiary of the group.
MEPs backed a greater share of state taxes for coal.
The change in fees for mineral extraction is to bring to the Treasury 427 million more than in 2013.
On revenue of municipal budgets by the government should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
In the year before the village received a fee of roughly 450 million and the state budget 150 million crowns.
For lignite mining communities was about 200 million and the state of 66 million crowns.
The amendment also allows for an increase of payment for mining area with a mining permit for a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these settlements has continued in full go to municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mladek (CSSD) deputies said the village so as to give a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
Stumpage amount will not be determined by law, but it provides Government Decree.
Payment shall be recalculated by multiplying the quantity of mineral extracted and rates for different types of minerals.
According to the government's reason for changing inter alia, to react flexibly to the current economic situation.
ODS deputy Marek Benda but warned that government regulation determining the fee may not be consistent with the Constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek but not in this case a tax because the state is imposed on mineral which is state property.
Charges only receive municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of underground coal mining will receive three-quarters of the money the village and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state on charges of mining chooses, will be assigned.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide mine rescue.
Artwork today criticized the opposition MPs who argued in particular that will damage the municipalities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kucera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that the mining company did not want to patronize the village as far as they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions only to the Minister of Finance improved the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) selected in the Usti region.
Before the rise of unemployment in the Most KSCM MEP warned Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject the law Kucera wanted to repay the government for completion.
The explanatory report says that by the mining companies to increase taxes not reflected in coal prices, because the prices are more than 90 percent of long-term contracted.
The main consumers such as power plants or heating plants would therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining companies will increase payments to compensate for the effort to reduce its operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," admits the government.
According to her, the increase of fees in terms of employment bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment Milan Urban (CSSD), it is crucial that MPs before the law was passed knew conclusions regarding the updated energy policy and the decision of the Government of coal mining limits.
If the coal mine well beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he said.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should be made until after 2020.
Limits on CSA mine, according to him should he break because of social, national economy and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time for a decision on interest rates by the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching how the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make major decisions about whether to raise interest rates for the first time after almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve will make a decision now think that remain idle for some time and kept interest rates at 0-0.25 percent range.
It is a historic event because it has been sat years from the time the Fed lowered rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where the major central banks might be able to get from zero slats and begin the process of normalizing interest rates, "says Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy was doing fairly well, there was a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and create only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed can not ignore the less rosy global outlook.
They warned the markets that they are prepared to increase, but circumstances suggest that also sees a big chance against this step.
The decision is to be announced Thursday, 8:00 p.m. CET.

Lamb also explain why the house shooting.
When police arrived at the scene found the body 41leté Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, which said: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me. "
After leaving a message with Lamb issued a 300-mile journey to the university Delta, killing a teacher of history Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Dean University of William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but that "the head of Mr Lamba was obviously something going on."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in a romantic relationship with Amy Prentiss Schmidt governmental authorities indicated that a "love triangle" there is "no evidence".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married with Prentiss over seven years, said it was "a great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
19-year old daughter O'Steena and Prentiss whole case was "shaken".
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According Linsday Knowles, a close friend Prentiss, as stated by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, went with Lamb about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
Police said Lamb on Monday talked with their relatives and said, "go to jail".
When police caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to the biography, which was published on the school website, Lamb earned his doctorate in education from the University Delta in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their charm
Actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right) has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, he fought with leukemia in 2009 and lost his longtime companion Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of these things will surely choose their toll.
Luke Shaw Manchester United will be a few months out of the game because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back left the wounds in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and think that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
Injuries caused ruthless crackdown Hector Moreno in the 15th minute when he was twenty Shaw came into the PSV space.
Nine minutes was treated on the pitch and it was also necessary oxygen mask before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double fracture of the leg and is now in hospital."
It will be taken tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then further surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it is very difficult, but played fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he had also deployed an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I believe that this season still play.
Moreno was lucky enough to get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli Mexican punish.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee mistaken.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly crackdown both feet.
Tweet from the account Shaw says: "I thank everyone for their messages, words can not express how I ruined my road to recovery starts now and come back even stronger."

England defender will have an added incentive to recovery as the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaving the field with such injuries, each of which is very sad.
It is never the aim of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg during the struggle for Mexico against Gaalová Van Holland at the World Cup 2014.
"It's very hard for him, because his intention was not to hurt him, and when you hear about the seriousness of the injuries, it's not good," said Cocu.
I was not able to perceive this moment.
I only saw the ball, which led in a different direction, so it seemed to him [Moreno] touched, but I saw crackdown on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult it can be such a thing.
I feel out of it very badly, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after the surgery Chris Smalling.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
This thing every parent knows: when a child falls in love with a book, not long before he learned it almost by heart.
But it may not be David Cameron.
On request the providers of children's schemes, to name a favorite children's book, chose Prime Minister Lorax, by Dr. Seuss fable from 1971.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report published on the company's website SuperCamps and continues: "funny, touching, creative and strong content, so I like to read to their children, because behind it was always the image or message that I have seen before. "
Well, except that the following paragraph in Cameron reportedly described the plot of the book by elevator from the film of 2012, which added additional characters and details to fill out a brief original text.
"In the city Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all of nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, that fulfills her wish to see a real tree," the brief content a book that chronicles the love object unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that alone was not enough suspicious text supplied by Cameron reads like a summary elevator movie The Lorax, which is located at the Internet Movie Database, and begins: "In the city Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all of nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey. "
Because he was openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron understood the plot of the book, where the unnamed young man learns that the local wildlife devastates avaricious, trees toppling industrialista Once-ler, who despite protests eponymous Lorax, crouching, mustache creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively insignificant task given the PR assistant who had never read The Lorax child 20 times in a row.
Downing Street spokesman said that the text probably came from the office of followers Cameron.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger omissions England, but still hold
Rival Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that chose England on this tour will be by me repeat 3-0 defeat suffered in the last Test series, not very likely.
I also would not rule out straight winning.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are also good players of spin in this bat assembly and collective thinking is strong; do not bear the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents the attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the England team experienced in the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
Decision to omit Adam Lyth for me is a tough one to analyze because its head coach is in Yorkshire.
Its worth seven tests against two good attacks in demanding conditions and simple, but the harsh reality is that cricketers are judged based on performance.
For example, by the name of Joe Root were no question marks, which led to the announcement, because - and this I stated earlier - the players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century and Lyth could extend his series, but he has control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire appears next opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, although his performances were not completely foolproof, and it does not surprise me; It was always a team player.
The question of how much time gets test batsman to show a hard nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps - just as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outdoors.
The only thing for which you could gripe is that England gave the first chance in the Caribbean Jonathan Trott - although Lyth was in top form - but this wasted opportunity is already history.
Here comes Alex Hales and it is a batsman who evaluate very positively.
It is the x-factor cricketer, whom we have seen in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when we won against 236 at Trent Bridge pitch that so little is being done.
It must at least be afforded the same opportunity that got his predecessor, but all this will depend on the overall assembly in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when Moeen begins alongside Cook, who would gain an extra spinner while also preserving the four quicks, was raised against it and I have no objections.
I do not understand why strokemaker not bat left-handed, and this man has already shown that it is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen might not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but it was their No. 3 and the big difference is that it is not.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before its withdrawal in 2001.
Immediately He has had three centuries and did not look back.
The team comes Zafar Ansari as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, I came across a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics - averaged 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and I see this as the punt, but not a lot Spinner, who raised their hands, and the selectors opted for youth.
A lot on this tour to learn.
Outside the team, it seems that England made a few changes and clever supplement their coaching staff.
Appointment Mahela Jayawardenea, batsman from Sri Lanka, as the consultant for Test matches can be a master stroke.
He is one of the most beautifully playing guys who bring a wealth of experience that they have experience with all the conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood coming in the tour-white ball and bring to the team both energy and ruthless spark.
I always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, as well as Mahela has the intellect, which can be used.
New voices in the locker room, even if they are consistent voices saying things that were said before, they can sometimes lighten and freshen the atmosphere.
Collyho Durham teammate Ben Stokes got a day off, as well as Root got a similar break against Australia and I with it no problem.
Although on many disagree, coaches and selectors do not schedule.
And you must remember, as the players that their work depends on the outcome.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
Brexit campaign could prevail if the economy in 2017 will stagnate.
Ill-conceived strategy of renegotiating David Cameron for keeping Britain in the EU gets into other problems with each passing day without selecting the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the head of the Workers' Party, or will he take TUC Tuesday through with the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Faragese.
A close friend of European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in a variety of crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have had enough of British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the agreement, which mostly did not want to.
At its annual meeting at Brighton TUC decided that even if they do not want to have eroded social protection.
We can even call selfie agenda Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor goes to the summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home, saying that they were winning allies for reform.
It's all just about me.
My European friend who wants to outward-looking Britain in the European Europe - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have gotten to the point where we left them on the matter.
Angela Merkel, the German prudently balanced Chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his post before her become ill, as it has for too long continuing Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl ( 16).
Frenchman Francois Hollande faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power also declined.
Poland may soon have a Nationalist government on the right side, left Spain.
It is difficult to look at how they break legs in helping Selfies British, who could better invest their energies to avoid in Scotland leaving the UK - which is something they want, they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately unhelpful remarks Style SNP during the referendum campaign in 2017 in Great Britain, to hasten the process Brexit, says a friend.
"The renegotiation solve the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value to the negotiations."
Europeans to their own detriment know how ferocious Fleet Street can be and how skeptical EU are printing oligarchs barons because they were inspired during a referendum Tony Benn in 1975, supported by our entry in 1973 in the ratio of 2: 1st
They can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, Euro-crafty opportunist who made his name as a reporter Brussels' EU straight bananas "in the early nineties.
Despite his vanity Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
Included a mix of villains paying taxes, foreigners hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, think of them Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a furious gorilla, you have to throw the bananas so that you did not give to dinner and then also to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair conceded the principle of the canceled EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and got his card being fired.
Print He's also never forgiven.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who me on Monday at Westminster friendly pat on the back - I told him that I had to not lose any time - seems to be in danger of re-accepting strategy boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy for engaging the media, not to me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose seat at the BBC on Sunday has left.
Corbinův official stance towards Europe, say it nicely, develops.
He claims that he wanted to remain in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of frantic tendency UKIP and wild shores Toryho small Englanderismu it can certainly proceed.
The same is said Hilary, "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout could not bring himself to admit that Corbynovo abrasive McDonnell appointment as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of 70 years old when his father fought on television about his loyalty, without going too far and lost his job.
Hillary match was much more attractive.
But the fight for it to remain "under all circumstances" - Bennin phrases - presumably not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said fellow Members and their private meeting on Monday evening,
Whatever the background of any sensitive image that wants to communicate Corbyn - remember, touched me as well - discipline reports, remains important in the ages-day television coverage, and especially in faith, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
Is it fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider support for the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign for granted, he said McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins's definitely thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbynovo basic equivocation regarding EU membership - in accordance with their Bennie besieging the economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between leftist dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.
Like his vykrucováním regarding Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that JC's campaign will not want to stop - Foreign diplomats are obliged to try to make sense of it all for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin to spend the political capital - have also suspicious voters - concessions for Britain, though it seems unnecessary?
United States are already quite disappointed with the briského "weak military power of Iraq, Libya and Syria, and reducing costs Conservative government in power as I was reminded on Monday zahájení something named Security Forum British influence.
Experts criticized the review published by the Agency for Electronic Public Health England
Statement by government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, emerged from a meeting of 12 people, of which some have links with the tobacco industry, say researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the criticism of the evidence used by the Lancet's report on electronic cigarettes agency Public Health England (PHE).
PHE agency published a "milestone" report last month, and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extremely flimsy foundation" on which the agency based its PHE main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ, disputed the claims that were supposedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They indicate that the public could expect to claim the agency PHE that reads "current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people convened for an analysis of multi-criteria decision (MCDA) model to synthesise their views on the damages associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell states that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.
Also approved the mandate of public health BAT in the sustainability report, it says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting acknowledged funding from manufacturers of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding, which reportedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, added.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but include several well-known champion of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claim in the newspaper industry funding.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
Meeting in PHE was also attended by tobacco lead.
The report resulting from this group, "eloquently admits" missing "hard evidence about the harmful effects of most products to most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or limitations not described in the report PHE.
McKee and Capewell said that allegations PHE that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a way for children to smoking or non-smoking," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare in PHE, said the BMJ allegations have been answered before.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifetime smokers will die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not displayed, especially when there was so much public confusion regarding the relative risk when compared with tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs the NHS £ 2 billion a year.
Clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not without risk, carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fulfill our national responsibility.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, says the former director of Channel 4
Former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcast programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "put his right hand" behind hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license fee should be used only for programs that are not made by another British television broadcast.
He criticized the BBC for that put on programs of public service, which will probably only follow a handful of people in complex broadcast times compared to its rivals' highest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he unsuccessfully tried to connect with the BBC for six years, he has worked on Channel fourth
"I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC entered and broadcasts programs that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," said Johnson Communications Commission in the Upper House, as part of negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you retain royalties, of which I am not sure whether they are in the medium to long term good idea, it should reduce the formation, at least in terms of programs that other manufactured or not entered.
The Voice broadcast in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that anyone else would not broadcast it, is a ridiculous joke, and of course absurd.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be financed bezpříspěvkově.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and naturally produced domestically.
Honestly additional channels would give them calmly right hand.
I can not understand how these public service broadcasters.
I do not think that it would in no way undermine the BBC.
Johnson, a businessman in the series, which led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty that drove ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked there, and because they believed that this is the best way to provide long-term support. "
His commentary on the popular BBC show repeats those former CEO of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that the BBC sells the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even hýčkanější programs of public service BBC "passes on BBC4, where quite often can not be measured audience, but fulfill its jurisdiction and may argue he is preparing for his hypocritical mission to justify the £ 4BN income from royalties," But of course we do all these obscure programs that no one is watching. "
They are broadcast at a time when nobody is watching them.
Regarding the license fee, commission Johnson said: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system of who gets it the best value.
Obviously, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a large sum, but for the people for whom it is £ 150 a lot, I would be surprised if many pay because the BBC so much watching.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its mission reithovskou meaning "to inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the small volume production of the BBC has now been previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take as a model public public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and to change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the subject of partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which has been on television odvysílána only a handful, and connect with commercial reporters that we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetika" or control brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses influence the direction in which the nematodes move.
Scientists raised the genetically modified worms nervous system, which can control the sound waves.
Tiny nematode changes direction when hit by sound pulses which are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses function to switch cells genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity with light
Scientists said that these worms are an excellent example of the new methodology called sonogenetika that uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method might one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which they are injected into the patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain. The method is used eg. To treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani discovered that the reaction will come when it is placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then passes through the body of worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves act on ion channels TRP-4, located in the membranes of certain cells of worms.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate cells, which they are linked, the report says the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP fourth
When then used for the modified worms ultrasound, sound waves microbubbles were amplified and transferred to the worm, where turning the power on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is a lot like optogenetice, groundbreaking tools that allow scientists to turn on and off neurons with light.
Chalasani but said that he sonogenetika could be compared to this technique many advantages.
Unlike the light that must be sent to the optical fiber at the desired location in the brain, the ultrasonic waves penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic virus can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical therapy for the treatment of neurological diseases," said Chalasani.
He added that his application would found a method for the treatment of muscle cells and insulin producing cells.

A cheerful voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advertising on the world's biggest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International for highlighting the willingness of the British government to sell arms to repressive regimes through the defense and security appliance International jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

They toyed with creating realistic risky business advertising, but "adding bright colors and animation, I have achieved that attracts more people."
"They did a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need is that the UK Government has taken measures to ensure that the torture device illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within Excel, where exhibitors sold fantastically euphemistic products.

Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
11 years ago I moved to college student as oblivious nineteen boy, still believe in berets and moral relativism, but until now, I recall a tense smiles of those who've bothered - and numerous, lengthy complaints on the other.
Everything I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to college can range from mildly irritating consecutively to totally appalling.
It is tempting to babble: tell people where you are, if you took a year off, what is your opinion on Corbyn and why "honestly do not love or hate Marmite not just because people are just yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to also breath - Ask questions and show interest.
It controls the conversation and help you find the people you love, and those with whom you would not talk even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would be published extinguishers.
Let people space.
Rooms people often change at drinker reception space movie nights and municipal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjusting her underwear.

High introverts come shortly.
Your bedroom should be a haven, but a lot of changes on the track mimopokojovou Prochazkova culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to a lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who needs to be recharged.
No culture does not allow you to say "I love you and I want to continue our friendship, but I need you to leave so that I could return to the energy I used up a conversation with you."
Try to recognize when a classmate tired of socialization - and maybe knock him your place.
Speaking about the knock: knock.
One boy in my dormitory had a habit that if the doors are locked, is invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make your friends through baking.
Since you started to attend college at the top of the baking mania, knocking on strange doors and performances with a sheet of baked cookies seem a little less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, something I bake, now I smile while I ask personal questions. "
Offering home cooking is a good way to find friends.
Your roommate will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe everything is over so that your face is assigned a tasty surprise.
It is of course that you are a decent baker.
Poorly condensed bits of flour, sugar and graphite zaruší likely that others will feign sleep when you try to knock them on the door.
Stealing food is on the student dormitories common crime.
Stealing a whole chicken is obviously a crime, but it is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Double-check it with the owner of the milk.
There are chances that you offer milk even when they are inside the rampage.
If someone steals something, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate, who gave her milk dishwashing detergent to punish thieves.
Now he's in jail.
You should not make noise that disturbs people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you are also notorious people in glass houses.
A girl from my hall asked my neighbors if they could quiet down a little drum and bass since they were 3 night and morning had examination.
Their response was amplification of music.
When he finally fell silent at 5 o'clock in the morning, let it sleep two hours and then let out his own music, locked the door and went to his three-hour examination.
Would not it be romantic if your future wife went to the same college as you?
Conversely, it would be shockingly embarrassing if you've got the wrong roommate for his future wife, slept together, broke up and had to see her every day, and might also assumed control over your common friends?
Of course, the heart neporučíš - but if your sexy roommate definitely not your future spouse, try at least a little talk with their weaknesses.
The uplifting moment when you realize that someone had left the keys in your unlocked room is only a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but easy to remedy.
Teach them a valuable and entertaining lesson about their security by allowing them to hide something - never mutilate someone's room toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and give them the keys to a bottle of water, which then stick it in the freezer - but they never affix their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.

Finally they got together around Vítek second birthday, and he now understands Vaška like his dad, and he thus addresses.
Although the Vasek has two adult daughters, fatherhood sixty the words used by their children and also pays more.
Vitek addition, a further two-year Leontýnka and eventually twins.
"Vasek our family floated somehow naturally, maybe the fact that my mother into the relationship never really talked," he says Eva smiling.
Little space?
At least we're close.
Twins Emma and Ela was born by Caesarean section after being Eve in late pregnancy diagnosed with cholestasis of pregnancy.
It is a disorder of production and activity of bile acids, which are then in an excessive amount found in the blood of pregnant and show especially pruritus.
The illness is dangerous for the unborn child at risk to premature birth and death of the mother after birth usually subsides spontaneously.
Ema and Ela to Eve and VASKOVA happiness born healthy, although they were only at 36 weeks.
Emic placed in an incubator at the intermediate department where he works and Vaškova niece who had managed to adapt and accommodate.
Eli was bigger and immediately after the transfer from the ICU room, I had it with me, describes the difficult period after childbirth Eve.
The hospital spent twenty days, until doctors not consented to the entry of the babies, who had managed to reach around two pounds.
Waiting for a gain of children in hospital but did not make Eve happy.
"I was mad with longing for her husband and children," remembers the difficult moments confinement department quadruple mother.
She thought of her husband and the signing of the reverse, due also to the callous approach of one of the doctors.
But this did not happen, and doctors released Eve and the twins to home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births CT1 broadcasts on Tuesday evening at 21:45 pm.
Total extended family knows how uskromnit.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric cooker and cramped conditions.
The House, although not increase, but Vasek did Eve joy installing the gas cooker to prepare food for six people comfortable.
When will nejůř, we will rotate a taxi.
Eva is convinced that children perceive particular family comfort and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or omšelost house.
For now, we pieced very good, better than we expected.
Although mess worse hiding in a small space and rolling babies sometimes transcend, but at least we are all nearby, smiles Eva, who can in each situation to find a positive side.
Vaškova work in film illuminator does not guarantee a regular income.
That's why sometimes leaves the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his sixty years, according to his words the care of children and family finances physically handle it, how long it but it will be?
"I realize that because of our age difference, I'll once I who will nourish this family," says Eva on the plane when querying for the future.
She would have returned to work, but even more attracted to her own business.
With four children, I'm not the employer moneymaker.
And if the worst, we can alternate with her husband on a taxi, sympathetic blonde jokes.
Apple suffered a yo-yo effect.
For everything they can display.
Powerful processor, a camera with higher resolution, more rigid chassis and display recognizing the power of touch, it is in a nutshell the advantages of the recently introduced iPhone ninth generation.
Those last two are having a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple's previous trend had been that each new generation iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
Exceptions were only the third and fourth generation, whose weight compared to previous iPhones increased slightly.
Dvougramový weight difference to the detriment of the news while he was really negligible.
That, however, for the new iPhone does not hold true.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus weight is increased by a smaller model of 14 grams, a larger then a full 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising last year affair bending in pockets considerably Apple teasingly.
Chassis subscription is thus a more resistant aluminum alloy 7000, which is also reflected on the weight.
But a much greater impact on that display.
Apple had applied for subscription Touch 3D technology, which makes the display will recognize the power of touch.
To do this it was necessary to provide the display with another layer of capacitive sensors.
Weight displays the new iPhone so than previous generations grew more than twofold.
The smaller iPhone from initially 12 g to 29 g, in case of more then from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s display it is so difficult to use component.
Weighing just 143 grams is then in this news reached thanks to a diet that has touched most of the remaining components.
For larger model is then used heaviest element in battery weight, but unlike predecessors had not changed.
Even in this case, the largest increase was seen in the display.
Weight 5.5 "iPhone 6s Plus and reaches 192 grams.
How will the new display technology practical, to take effect during use.
The first users will be able to try it as early as Friday, September 25, when it will be launched in selected countries selling the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
They Flakes breakfast of champions tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci archaeologists managed to achieve a finding that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered that traces of modern human settlements from different eras, including murals, remnants of tools and so on and so forth.
In the layer 23A, which is the instruments date back about 30 years ago but scientists discovered but something very much like the remnants of breakfast.
On the site they had in fact had traces of oat grains that are on view apparently undergone a process of production so popular today flakes.
When it was first soaked grains today, then dried, freed from the package, called. Husks, then scald and distinguishes flat.
The cave was discovered Paglicci grain, which was apparently recorded or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least that indicate traces of using two stones in the cave.
Scientists have therefore failed in his publication for the journal PNAS demonstrate that it took place in a cave entire production process flakes, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
It also has no evidence on how people could eat flakes, but presumed it was with some fluid and perhaps even warm, the course offers a completely logical.
It is also a very interesting document of how intensely people took advantage cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
As long as the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes overtook agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
The new reporting stations in the Transport Company of Brno.
So I once again listened to the report the names of the stops on the trolley: Hnusáčkova, Phantom, phrase, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolley was quite noisy, so reports masculine voice was somewhat less clear than before, when the station reported by a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so the deeper the noise of traffic is more recognizable than the deep male voice.
While DPMB argues that this broadcaster chose the passengers themselves - I do not know who, I did not ask anyone, but it certainly chose from studio recordings taken in silence, which of course sounded quite differently than in the din of the bus engine.
I live in Brno quite few decades, so the correct names of all those zastávkek I knew by heart, so I this report do not need, but foreigners elsewhere, who in Brno unfamiliar and that these reports are primarily intended, may be confused and may at the end, where they arrived by mistake, then say that the bus in which they appear, was not reported at all.
Maybe he had the choice of broadcasters - but better again announcers - do it again, and this time tinged with the usual traffic noise and roar of the engine, in which kuňkání speaker on the bus almost lost.
You did not listen anymore station names Water Herspice, snoop, or creaking then Immersion in Salina, where I transferred Komarov.
I suppose my old man's hearing did not deteriorate suddenly so much during that one day when the announcer stops changing.
Before that day, I understood the message to those quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From scraps traťováka.
Today few people know what the government side for the biggest and brightest were called. Comprehensive review.
I allowed myself to remember.
The bus was late.
Office dispatcher I ran when the radio sounded, it is just seven hours.
"You're lucky he did not strike comrade chief, came a minute before you and it seems that is not really in the mood," said the dispatcher, as I wrote in the book's arrival.
Thanks, I'll watch it.
Write to me that I'm going after wards to revise small mechanization.
That will not work, today they are still checking.
All of them are fucking up horror.
What is it?
"You'll see," he sneered dispatcher.
Next time you will too.
I ran out into the hallway.
The door opened and appeared náčelnikárny chief.
Narrow, stone-faced and crisply uniformed.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I greeted politely and quickly turned two knobs jackets uniforms.
"Good morning," was the answer, and I quickly ran to the second floor, but I realized the cold, sinister tone in which old said.
"You're playing," she greeted me engineer Eva, an elderly lady that I greatly respected.
Apparently even the chiefs and before she deposed comrades.
They're checking and those barely arrive.
How many times have I asked what are the most comprehensive review, but no one does not want to talk much.
They say usually once every three years, to have them all, and it's pretty annoying.
At least for some.
But apparently I am seeing.
I pulled out of the drawer dossier with periodic reports and suddenly the phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me," said náčelníkův voice.
What bothers?
Now we met and nothing ... "I muttered, but no one answered me, everybody just my thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I came to your orders," omeldoval I've barely stepped into náčelnikárny.
Chief sat at his desk and looked a little piece of paper.
"Comrade mechanizátor," he said after a moment, without looking up, still carefully examining this little piece of paper, "your behavior I do not like."
He threw the little piece of paper on the table, leaned back in his chair and stared at me with the usual crush, nasty, evil, piercing eyes.
I faltered.
What's happening?
Yesterday the deputy lauded for those few months in office I have worked very well and that is to me extremely satisfied.
That the chief did very well when I pulled out of the squad at the distance.
And now this?
Realize that you're traveling distance technician and according to that you have to behave.
Such a greeting, how you used this morning, is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that such a greeting used since childhood, I was so brought up, and that see nothing wrong with it.
On the Chief was like a red rag to a turkey.
"You're a socialist railways and the only acceptable greeting is an honor to work," he snapped grim chief.
And still wrong addressing superiors.
Once you say "sir" and once again "comrade".
But I'm not for you, Mr. Chief, but comrade chief.
Deputies are comrades deputies, chief traťmistři are comrades top traťmistři!
Please remember it!
Excuse me, sir ... Comrade Chief, but ... I greet you normal civic salute.
There's nothing wrong ... and an honor to work or comrade ... you know ... I'm not in a party ...
"It's not your preference, you're not in the side," he said coldly chief, who had calmed down.
But more about that will be discussed.
Anyway, remember that the chair received the top prepaid retirement.
This was not good.
When the chief told someone something that is not his priority, with that it did not look good.
While he is glaring at me cold, piercing gaze and I searched for words to answer.
It also irked his haughty tykání.
It was only a few years older and played at Lord God, actually soudruhaboha.
Jovial, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant as he threw it at the moment.
To him all the feces.
Okay, it's chieftain.
Well, not everyone, chairman of the Party organization was like all straníkům, but nestraníkům, related.
But the chief Tykal many, especially those with which it could exercise its supremacy.
Right now, he wiped the complete crap.
I thought about something fucked up and it cost me quite overwhelming, I did not shoot him in the face.
Except that it would not return to the štrekou pickaxes, let alone keep doing a railway official.
From what I live off two kids?
And this unfinished house!
I felt like crying, but I restrained myself.
I would not do it.
"That's all, you can go," retired chief audience, and began again to closely view the little piece of paper that he had in his hand.
At half past eleven Me summoned.
All of the agencies were already there, and questions of what and how, answered that yes, it will be good.
Just Joey sarcastically said, as was his habit, that all of us can throw out because they would have to do the job, Comrade Chief himself with his faithful, and that there is no risk.
The word "comrade" he emphasized, as if he knew, what I am old wiped.
In náčelnikárně was a nice reunion.
Comrade chief behind his desk at a long conference table other comrades who should decide about my clerk existence or nonexistence.
To screen, chairman of ROH, reporter of personnel, officer for special purposes, sort of a contrast to the army, and a deputy, my boss.
And the most important person, chairman of the Party organization.
I knew him from a long way.
Ordinary railway worker, tamped sleepers or pitchfork throwing gravel.
But also a former prison guard.
It was rumored that back with him was often no joke, apparently pretty beast.
Evil tongues claimed that the school came in seventh grade, the nevyučil nothing, nothing he could not.
And when he canceled the jail, he ended up on the stretch with pickaxes.
But comrade, yeah, comrade was forged!
Chief motioned me to sit down.
It was in me pounding in my throat nespolknutelná cone.
Read screen the opinion of the civic committee of the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I am married with two children, and so on and so forth.
So far so good, I thought, and now I breathe a trifle better.
Then the judgment of the street party organization.
He followed the opinion of the citizens' committee, perhaps the same person wrote both.
But then it happened!
Parents longtime party members refused to appear before the Screening Commissions and subsequently leaving the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
To screen he noticed it and stopped reading.
Chief gestured that to continue.
Beyond that, it was just worse.
I was a member of the municipal council of SSM and there I was obtained as a candidate for the party.
Regardless of parents who are leaving the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I was married and the wedding in addition to the national committee, I was also in the church.
I failed the trust of the parties in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from among its candidates.
But it was not enough!
Both my children to be baptized, and even her mother when she died, I went ecclesiastical funeral, although he was a former member of the party.
All this makes clear negative attitude to the leadership role of the Party.
When I screen the finished, only the chief tapping a pencil on the desk top punctuated by tense silence.
Everyone stared at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
And I constantly repeated in the spirit of "Communists - supermen communists - supermen." What have I gotten myself into?
Why I prefer not stay at smiths?
I could repair the turnout even without some fucking checks.
But now?
Rail career officer took her before it began.
Return to the squad?
It's impossible, I am sure chief of the hour set off.
"Comrade, how have you checked under discussion comrade?" He broke the tense silence chief question on the screen the list.
Well, according to the assessment of previous employment.
You have him here?
To screen apparently was not twice.
At temples sweat, blinking nervously, as if he himself were scanned.
Eagerly nodded and handed the chief piece of paper.
"Well," said the chief with a hint of joviality, but it was often a harbinger of the storm.
At first glance same praise, trained with honors, graduated from technical college, worked by piecework labor as a locksmith, standard fulfills an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But what is essential is missing.
Where did you get the report, comrade? "He asked again to screen the list, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him, and that very soon, perhaps even have to be appointed to screen.
Here comrade gave it to me, at the onset.
This gives you enough?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the squad," he babbled to screen.
And there are reports not required, his was somehow more, so I gave it to a folder.
"So when put into the technical features let this piece of paper was enough," said chief dryly.
To screen blinking nervously and do not have the answers.
"Never mind, it will discuss later," concluded the chief matter to screen and looked relieved.
So far it endured.
"So what are you, comrade?" Chief turned back to me.
Suddenly I Vyka, so this is the end!
My eyes darkened, doused me hot.
Followed by a barrage of reproaches and accusations, and I knew that I was the most disgusting creatures on earth that does not deserve the slightest mercy.
The substitution of an incomplete report, I misled Comrade cadre officer, while I could not understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from the factory to screen.
I also anti-socialist element that during the building of socialism supports whirl of religious obscurantism, nay, even participating in them.
That it was a lot of what I've done, or perhaps even to commit and I quietly prayed that it ended.
I've been indifferent.
I did not care that fly out of place mechanizátor.
I did not care that I take even the pick.
This is a job for an honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people, which I have in the eyes of the chief comrade.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," said the party chairman suddenly and emphatically interrupted the chief Levites.
Here comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What mistake did you crap!
But he's already got his punishment!
Do not forget, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than it had at the time we close the door to the side!
To him opened again, will have to prove that he has changed, it is once again worthy of our trust.
Uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
It's so well read or parroting phrases from partisan trainings and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must receive from us a chance!
The chance to prove he's changed.
And he who has put it, if not just those Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to the young, a true comrade somewhat misguided, and supported in its efforts to remedy!
It's your duty to the party that you never get!
Actually, it's party also have the duty of all of us.
Here comrade must see that side of him remembered.
That as a good mother not only punished, but they also loved.
When the President was finished, nobody nehlesl.
Such a turnaround situation nobody expected.
At least I do.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," said Chief of ice in an attempt to once again take the initiative.
If you'd let me finish, you'd hear that just such a conclusion I was headed.
They all nodded their heads in agreement, but it was for them to see that he did not believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of an independent examiner care of basic resources," I whooped when I return to the office and then I started crying.
Even apart from that engineers Eve were all at lunch.
She listened in silence to my incoherent makeup fresh experiences and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, I asked whether I'll have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, he puts water on the stove and prepared cups.
Meanwhile talked about kádrováckých practices.
As one report, often full of praise, give the man in your hand, and one in which many a dirt send new employer.
But I finished where I should have, but stretch with pickaxes, so comrades from the factory did not know where it should be sent.
And our screen the list?
He just cares where you ate or drank, and so it turned out as it did.
"He's from the old gets it," she said mischievously.
Today it certainly will not taste good.
Well to heed him is pretty vindictive.
And party chairman?
In fact far worse chief, not a philanthropist.
Zero picks from having great power.
Water for coffee began to boil, and then the office was filled with the scent drenched coffee.
I threw in a cup and a sugar cube in silence mixed hot potion.
Maybe I'm out of the woods.
Now throw me and other clearances for three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief me that today, just forget it.

Symbol of the village alive.
Vane wheel over Chlumem after years of spinning again.
It can be seen from afar, because it is located fifteen meter high mast.
People from the neighborhood call him "fan Chlum".
For the village with 150 inhabitants became even one element of a municipal character that the municipality received on the occasion of the meeting of the natives in 2010.
"We applied back then about the character and the fan we obviously wanted to have a character, he knows everyone in the neighborhood," said Mayor Jiri Masek.
Chlumsky wind pump is local technical monument.
It's also a little memento of our time: namely recalls a time when local people are fighting for drinking water quality.
That in Chlum in past centuries was a rarity.
Until in 1910 they decided chlumští councilors for solutions that suit then until the mid-eighties.
In the village at the turn Číchov left to excavate seven meters deep well.
Three years later, still well supplemented metal construction with a wind pump that water pumped into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonin Kunc from Hranice cargo of 2,400 crowns," says the inscription on the memorial ground construction fence pole.
Pump after several corrections and crashes windmill its day in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, then began writing a new chapter in the struggle for water: that day in Chlum began serving a new water supply.
Wind pump has remained inoperative only a symbol of municipal and local rarity.
Dominating launched at this year's meeting natives.
Only in 2008 Chlumští decided to repair the windmill again and bring back into operation.
They had to make a replica of the original wheels - reduced on average by half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on a pole, the same year but had to be carried down down.
Manufacturer reply, it did not choose the right material and the bike did not know how to resist wind gusts.
Then Chlumská dominant for several years rested dismantled under the roof.
Since June this year, however, the wheel on the high pole again spins.
On the occasion of the meeting of natives leaving village replica wheels to adjust and re-manned the iron on top of the tower.
But round draw potable water from wells just to overflow billabong.
And this summer we had totally disconnected because the well water was scarce.
The film was shot at least idle.
"In the autumn, the shaft windmill pumps from the suction strainer disconnect again," explained the mayor Masek.
Chlum is not the only municipalities in the Czech Republic, where the wind came round to the municipal emblem is not the only village of its kind in the whole Highlands.
A similar element in the character have to honor local technical monuments, for example, in CHVALKOVICE and Green Mountain at Vyškovsku in Kuželov the Hodonin, Partutovice to Prerov or in Police Vsetínsko.
No offense, but Lafata know, she admitted foothold Tripoli Goian.
"The match against Slavia remember very well, my goal, as all my career," smiled the 34 year old Goian at the pre-match press conference.
At that time, he trained Georghe Hagi, it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope I'll score even now Sparta.
With the only difference that this time, not lose, "said Goian.
Now this man who has played 60 matches for the Romanian representation is a key mainstay of the Greek team.
As the stopper will face the Spartan offensive raids.
Comes a few thousand people, no hell, says the Greek Spartan duel Hybš.
And some idea of what he can expect on Thursday night.
Well known Fataie, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
At that time, I saw all of their matches.
I know that this is a very good striker, so he went to Sparta, said Goian.
Další Prague football club did not name, and then came the direct question whether he knew and David Lafata, top scorer in the history of the Czech league and Sparta captain.
Goian smiled slightly accusing look headed for Czech journalists.
Baffled expression on his face signified: "Why are you asking me this?"
After a moment of silence began.
We've seen some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot as a team.
It has really good players.
A Lafata?
No offense, but I do not know anybody else except Fataie.
It Spartans on Goian knows very well.
"My experience of the bigger clubs can say that the defense holding Asteras, it's sort of their game organizer," observed Sparta assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian Although he has the best years behind him, but it boasts a very interesting football biography.
Its time for him interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both teams Manchester United and City, but from Steaua headed into the Italian Palermo also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We wait aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a great team, playing regularly European Cups, washed with a victory in the Czech league.
For me, the favorite in this match, but we play at home and we want the group to start a good result.
Like Sparta we will try to win, said Goian.
I was in the room with the Slovakian goalkeeper Tomas Košice, who is an opponent of the Czech enjoying a lot.
I also.
But for the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic considering joining the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should be Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola SA It was registered in Poland because of trading companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the Czech Republic.
The steps we have so far undertaken under the project are mainly legal and administrative, and have no real impact in society, says Daniel Buryš, Financial Director of the Kofola group.
"In connection with the relocation of the seat of shareholders consider the placement of shares on the PSE."
Due to the entrance to the Prague Stock Exchange completes the company prospectus to be submitted in the near future Czech National Bank for approval.
Move the seat of the holding company and the related transfer of shares will be effected by the private transactions that are in it will participate only existing shareholders.
In this operation, therefore, they will not be offered any shares for subscription to the public or to new investors.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would take place - unless a way the company and its shareholders to - later, either in Q4 2015 or Q1 2016," the company said.
The company has previously stated that any offering of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or sell existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock market in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test objectivity Czech Television reporting on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of news from the major Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time, the main news broadcast of the Czech Television.
And how prevailed?
Once at the faculty of journalism teach about how the media can manipulate reality can let today's Czech Television Events.
Migrant crisis was devoted about 80% of broadcast news.
Aside from the first minute when Czech Television reported on riots in the Serbian-Hungarian border and attacks on migrants euphemistically called the police reached them patience - threw stones and attacked with iron rods), it went promigrantská current propaganda - judge for yourself the names of individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in Czech schools - the story of integrated Syrians in the country.
Refugees not only as a threat but as an opportunity.
Wandering refugees - Thu consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee and migrant not.
What is striking is mainly that of CT in B-Roll is used consistently and only shots of young children and women.
While alone in the same broadcast stated that the migrants detained in the Czech Republic is 80% of men.
Summary: For the most part propaganda, which is unprecedented since the communist agitek.
I must say that as a former journalist for fellow ashamed.
Ecology in practice.
When I once prospered to on prefab apartment, I soon ceased to be the sole inhabitant.
Formica on the toilet, I moved in silverfish.
Silverfish insects with an imperfect metamorphosis, ie., That neprodělávající transformation from caterpillar to the beetle and the baby looks like an adult, just a little and gradually grows.
It was disgusting and I did not hesitate to kill.
First manually and later chemically.
Socialist drugstore at their disposal to provide some sort of blue crystals.
I think it was called Zyklon B.
Or something else?
It wipes it is however successfully.
Later I dealt with the pharaohs alike.
A box with some juvenalizátorem who brought the ants in the nest, and then he did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, he became even insects object of my admiration and, increasingly, I was inclined to believe that they have the same right to life as we humans.
Plus I took from life experience that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace the other.
Truth with fleas and bedbugs would probably hesitate to worsen the karma of killing.
In the new home, we have a partner agreed that if we do not silverfish crawling neck, let the rest eat chips renegade skin, some of those invisible algae and the like.
Their peaceful existence in time undermine the spider.
It was a common species pokoutníka, who has long lived on the ceiling.
We thought that the lives of occasional flies and mosquitoes, which we only increased comfort.
Because we lived for several years, we found that feed primarily on silverfish and their numbers apparently kept to a tolerable numerical status.
Confidential regular contact with every need done, we found that it was a female.
We are witnesses of romantic courtship with a partner about a third less, as gently strumming the gossamer web that has not been eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days when he did not move and did not react to our control.
Under the toilet where a sex took place, we are beside the females later found the remains of dried male.
Then the spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought that now it is behind us surprised many small spiders hanging scattered around her.
Soon they disappeared.
Work had been devoured by her mother, partly scattered elsewhere.
Even a week after the female vanished.
If you moved away or passed away, we do not know, but after a month, two, reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that praobyvatelky toilet.
For some time the ceiling warily watched our behavior and movement below the toilet evaluate our nonaggression as friendship.
Manpower rather multiplied silverfish again declined spider in peace watched their normal activities to ensure food.
All year long our ecosystem unchanged.
Our daughter arrived at between the age for using the potty it was a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated, but eternal pouring out its contents already we zajídalo.
We urged her still more strongly to use the toilet.
My daughter, however, to maintain his habit has found an excuse in that spiders to whom at wiping very well seen.
We talk about the spider to see happiness in the house shall have failed to take it.
Crying and yelling necessitated his potty.
Was no avoiding it.
There was a moment when he had a spider in the interest of development shift daughters command.
That left it up to me.
He was captured in a jar and recognized over the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I was after so long coexistence felt awful, like I threw relative.
We assumed that the silverfish begin to appear more frequently and begin to multiply exponentially.
Lo and behold, a week or two, we did not find any there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if you are there the spider along the lines of ants somehow have not grown to the toilet environment is not as favorable to their existence, as we thought.
Then they saw the first pieces of medium size, and they are swarming again.
I had to think of another theory about the cause of their disappearance and what I've discovered that their binding to the spider had to be due to the fact that when he sees that it is hidden somewhere else, and that they were in danger anywhere.
Or, maybe they have a telepathic connection with his predator and its rapid disappearance of them provoked an alarming reaction.
The more so that their eyesight no illusions.
Some light showed shyness, but that would respond to the waving hands or quick movements, no.
Daughter already goes to the toilet regularly.

Ten Commandments statements of Albert Einstein, who enriched the world.
Statements brilliant scientist of the last century, mankind seems to never cease to fascinate.
He could do everything delve so deeply that it was a figment always astounding findings.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
The awareness of people came especially his special and general theory of relativity, which is still best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
We can not also forget the clarification of the photoelectric effect, or the idea of quantization of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the mere description of a system of knowledge theory of relativity is popular for many so convoluted that on closer acquaintance often choose the easy comparisons.
But it's not easy.
However, would not it Albert Einstein, even if this ingeniously found a simplified form of explanation: the watch close to your beloved seem a minute; timer in a hot oven seems an hour - and it's relativity.
I took the liberty of his whole parade of famous quotations choose these ten, which literally fascinated me.
Smart people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying to do.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
In the first, I'm not so sure.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
But only one can ever prove that I was wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to split the atom than destroy prejudices.
If the desktop clutter reflects the disorder in mind, what then reflects empty table?
I do not know what they will fight the third world war, but in the fourth it will be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but not how to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and know a lot, too.
If I had available an hour to cope with the problem, which would depend my life, I spent 40 minutes of his studio, his analysis of 15 minutes and 5 minutes of its solution.
The world's most difficult thing to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I can not forgive omit Einstein's formula on the definition of success: Taking A success, apply the formula: A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y and Z rest is keep his mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospital in Zlin region waiting for change for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that the whole of this year, all four holding in the black," he said happily governor Stanislav Misak.
Total profit regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million.
Impact comes mainly higher payments from insurance companies, which are just as favorable for this year.
This fact shows that after years of poor hospitals can finally afford major investments.
Kromeriz, Vsetin and Zlin Uherske Hradiste is due this coming to the buildings, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion.
The long period when we were buying major appliances, ended.
Now we have to start building a new building, because without them the top health do not give, he explained the plans for the regional deputy health Lubomir Necas.
Changes enjoying in all hospitals.
Builders go to the hospital early next year.
Vsetin now select suppliers of new internal pavilion for nearly 300 million.
Kromeriz have planned extension of dialysis.
Hungarian Hradiste wants to open this year, the central pavilion and built up a new internal for about 200 million.
A Zlin Bata Hospital awaiting a long-delayed construction of a new central TV and Internet, which will have three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is the fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and physicians is an extremely important step," she said, for example, to the construction of internal Vsetin hospital director Vera Prousková.
The five-storey building there has to be ready in about two years and offers comfortable amenities for internal medicine and neurology, dialysis, a new ambulance, beds and intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
Changes that greatly recognize especially the patients, will affect all regions.
The new building is to replace those in which, for example, many patients lying in one room on the first floor may only have one toilet, beds are Non-adjustable, leaking windows and health professionals do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our in-house was built thirty-five years ago, and now it is the end of its useful life," he pointed out the director of the hospital Zlin Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, because it replaces a seven-storey modern building connected with the ED.
Physicians and patients will have the same place all acute separation, additionally in new areas.
The same model is already half finished dissertation received.
Central intake already standing, and within three years it will be added interna.
"The building will pay on the loan and partly from its own resources," explained the director Petr Sladek.
Now the hospital's own funding may be the only one in the county afford.
Profit is still high and the loss does not even two years ago, when necessary Zlin hospital faced almost dvousetmilionovou loss.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, are increasing revenue and effectively manage IT costs in the hospital," she enumerated Vlastimil Vajdák who has charge of the economy.
Improvements will also benefit patients and Kromeříž hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years will go to repairs, new equipment and renovations to half a billion crowns.
Already this year, will complete the repair detention center, then begin dialysis extension or construction of a building for the new MRI.

Nobody explained to me how I had received refugees in the country to maintain when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) after talks with his European colleagues complain that other states Czech pushing the adoption of a quota reallocation of refugees, but rejected any discussion.
Also notes that he has not yet been explained how it had allocated refugees in the Czech Republic to maintain when u want us to live well.
"The response we have received, so we wanted to make quotas were eliminated from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
You can specifically describe the position with which you came to the meeting of Ministers of Interior and Foreign Ministries of the European Union?
We disagree with mandatory quotas as a system that can not work.
A migrant can not speak as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some vision, heading somewhere, have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we can get migrants into the territory of the Member States to maintain if it is redistributed.
We can not imagine.
We did not get an answer, so we wanted to make quotas were eliminated from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, ie the place of registration, protection of borders, camps outside Europe Trust Fund for African countries and other things with that we have no problem.
We talk about it a year and say that this is the way to go.
But to say that quotas solve everything?
Not long ago, we solved forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how those people on that territory we keep?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us, wants to Germany.
To almost no one wants us, we just do not know how to keep them here.
We have ambition to go other foreigners Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country in our gain asylum, but the interest of the people of this migration wave, ie from Syria and other countries, it is close to zero.
You've mentioned that to us refugees did not really want to, but fifteen hundred people have already pledged to accept.
It would be impossible to take them this way more?
We are committed to take 1,500 people, but with the condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border control and military operations.
Even those in 1500 in terms of that comes 1,100 people, with whom we will process the asylum procedure.
They come into our detention facilities, and we will treat them just like the ones we picked.
The big question, and we'll talk about it with Europe if we can detain people who are registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe has to behave in such a way that if the registration can not be detained.
That means, come to our territory with registration, and if the agreement, which is not yet, it may happen that even those not hold in 1100 in the Czech Republic and they after coming back to the German leave.
If we can hold during the asylum procedure, arrange them asylum procedure.
If they are not citizens of Syria, Eritrea, and almost 98 percent according to European statistics are gaining international protection.
Then they get documents that allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people end up again in the target countries.
Then there's four hundred people who will be relocating.
This is the second project, which is still gaining momentum, and there we progressed only in the fact that we debate with churches about the possibility that he knew how to help them obtain jobs, housing and so forth.
But it is run by a very long haul.
You said at the meeting of ministers with us the other states were not willing to discuss.
But it is not so that only the Czech Republic rejects quotas, but does not offer any solidarity action which would unlock the discussion?
And what exactly should you be in solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany utters an incentive that all migrants from Syria can for them, so the message spread in several hours after the camps all over Europe but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages further migration wave that was heading to Germany because we just do not want to.
We think that the way to protect the external borders - simply the waves of migration discouraged, help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Definitely let them see that they have no chance.
Just last year in Germany came to fifty thousand Kosovars.
For safe Kosovo, where we pay all this saturation state, including the police, courts, prosecutors' offices.
If we could separate them and to reject them or accept them only according to the needs of the economy and the fifty percent of what they are today social systems vain issued, could go on refugees.
Compared to the first date on which Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty-first day it was twelve.
How far it has come to border controls have tightened?
We feared capture of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers that we manage.
We still have several hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all people who are withholding, we will return within seven days Austria.
We do it by default.
Austrians are the ones who take us to the people, with Hungary's complex and Greeks - it is pointless story.
So where is the breaking point?
It would have to be worth a thousand a day?
I think that it would have to be worth several hundred a day.
Two or three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days they run out of capacity so that the board contingency plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that it would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is the whole thing very interested, we have several times a day in phone contact.
Should the situation arise, the government can sit de facto immediately and one resolution would have decided to reinforce the police to the army, say customs administration or by the prison service.
Extreme variant of the state of emergency, which was now in some places declared Hungary?
I think that for us it can not be that far.
Remember that our position is different, we have a national state within Europe, the Schengen border, and we have only just at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen for it to be this one in the Czech Republic happened, I do not want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggest rather that the Hungarians try to divert migration flows to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
Czech Republic, this would hurt very marginally, almost all.
Slavia repaid at the last minute a large part of the debt.
They are trying to prevent bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia pay debts.
Their money and waited to see footballers.
Soccer Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Nearly three months after her for about 20 million meters crowns the company filed for Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
Counsel Susan Slavia Mládková trying to Judge Michael Wenzlová few hours to convince that it has over Slavia fail.
And I must say that the argument had.
One of the main arguments was that two weeks ago the new owner of Slavia become a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and the Czech billionaire George Šimáně.
Apparently the new owners arrived to the club money, and at the last moment.
This is demonstrated by expression of Slavia before Tuesday's court hearing - Vrsovicky club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, he sent owed tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was between Sept. 11 and Sept. 15 paid," said attorney Slavia Mládková.
To Slavia paid?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example exreprezentantovi Milan Ivana Slovak or Czech midfielder Mario Licka.
Slavia also pay a fee agent Alexandru Losenickemu.
On Friday the club has paid and fees owed the city of Prague on the 10th
Part of the insolvency proceedings and remain de facto only claims that Slavia contradictions.
Either by the club commitments not have arisen, or are they leading litigation.
However, we are ready in the event of losing these disputes amounts.
"The necessary funds have a bank account, which can be documented by a statement of account," the judge told the lawyer Mládková.
"Everything that was overdue, is paid for," said Mládková, adding that outstanding are only immature or disputed commitments.
It is also certain that in the coming days and the judge decides the proceedings will continue.
Slavia has given three weeks to send detailed evidence that actually paid mentioned debts.
Subsequently will assess all the evidence.
Decisions can be expected soon in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of negotiations on November 3.
However, the decision will fall even at this meeting, but only after writing it.

He said this on Wednesday evening when journalistic tour of the tunnel.
It would be but according to him, about half a billion crowns more expensive.

It's always a trade-off between cost and safety.
"The tunnel was minted safer, but costs are rising exponentially," said Butovič.
Conditions at Stromovka were, according to him all the time the same, yet the country fell a few paces from where he started minting safer and more cautious method.
"If there was one measure is used about 500 meters before the tunnel would have been about half a billion more expensive," said Butovič.

Zisky FedEx mixed, reducing the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx announced disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in full-year profit forecast due to low demand for freight transport, and higher costs for land division.
The company also said it plans to hire over the holidays about 55,000 seasonal workers.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it will hire for the holidays 50,000 seasonal workers.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in předtržním trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings of between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 for the fiscal year, which ends next May, a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $ 10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January. 4, and higher bonuses for overland transport of heavy or large packages, which start in November.
The company said it still expects earnings growth over the previous year due to cost reduction, higher incomes and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is "showing off a solid performance despite a weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival company UPS said it plans to hire 90 000 to 95 000 workers in addition, which is about the same as last year hired.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31 FedEx gained $ 692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share were $ 2.42, which is less than $ 2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts interviewed Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $ 12.23 billion.
FedEx has recently been hit by a drop in priority international shipping, causing revenue in the Express unit stagnated.
But the boom in online shopping boosted results FedEx ground troops.
In the last quarter increased land revenue by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger parcels and their own insurance.
Express unit reported higher income due to higher base rates, while earnings declined in the cargo trade due to higher prices for labor.
In předtržním trading for about an hour before the opening FedEx shares fell $ 3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $ 150.15.
Ukončili Tuesday with a decline 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the record of June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week, seated at 27 feet long Honduran mahogany table and they will decide whether, after nearly ten years, the time has come to raise the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the central bank ornaments, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The central bank has a dual charge of Congress: American maximize local employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to a predictable decision, which is to be Thursday announced whether the US economy is ready to run when you shut unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rate in place since end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid growth of the economy, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could no longer frighten the Fed cautious about adding to volatility by raising its benchmark federal funds rate - even for nothing more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think just looking for an excuse to no increase rate, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market they already provides sufficient justification to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently polled by Blomberg anticipated rate increase this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed will delay the matter, the key indicator of only about 30% chances to increase.
It would be pointed to the decline in the stock market if the Fed will raise rates only if politicians soften the downturn promise that the next increase is in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The Assembly has triggered expectations that politicians Fed holds rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he says.
If politicians Fed did, "they would go to the extreme in its policy statement and hold the hands of the financial markets to not panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Fed is on track to increase rates by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that through the spring and early summer are expected to increase rates this year despite complaints from liberals, the need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labor market this year saw solid growth.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And even if inflation continues to progress under an annual 2% of the central bank, Fed policymakers argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
Economy 'can cope with higher rates and needs to, considering the tightness of the labor market, "said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to convulse late last month after China devalued its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell as much as 16% below its record level in May, as investors worried that a slowing Chinese economy dragged down global growth.
The market is somewhat reflected in the Dow this month and now only lose almost 10% from the May peak.
Fed policymakers market turmoil adds complex calculus where to start increasing interest rates.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and news of weakness in the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a leading researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now predicts that it will wait at least a month in order to gain better control over the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty as to what impact this will have on the US economy, and have almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," said Oliner.
State of health of the global economy is a major concern for the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority worldwide.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint then chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, the Fed could "narrow" their monetary expansion in the market, triggered spasms throughout the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it is expected that Fed officials also monitor developments elsewhere, but also consults with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., Said this month that "the Fed has a history of excessive movements in the financial markets, which seem incoherent with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to lower its interest rates by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions "Despite the limited identifiable impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.
Fed should prioritize financial stability concerns only during a crisis, as was the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the committee setting out the rates at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil to even come close to that level, he said.
"You do not want to be in a situation of fear of growth rates, because the markets are outraged," said Posen, president of the Institute for International Economics Peterson.
The law of the Federal Reserve System has a dual mandate even a mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should get to the top.

Speed on motorways remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km / h the House rejected it.
On selected sections of motorways can not be increased under favorable conditions the maximum speed to 150 km / h.
On Tuesday, the House decided that she went to the Senate amendment, which increase the rate declined.
The amendment to the road and now heads to the president.
President Milos Zeman has said in late April that the law allowing vetoed hundred miles an hour.
Against the increase was the Transport Minister Dan flux (YES), according to which the Czech motorway network yet at that speed is not built.
Ťok Tuesday before MPs supported the Senate version of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow in accordance with the original government proposal increasing the speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on the selected first class roads, mainly four-lane.
Deputies initially extended this option even on the highway, on which would be put to ride in selected sections of speeds up to 150 km / h, but the Senate rejected it.
MPs now on his proposal came.
Senators with the approval of the Minister of Transport of the amendment brought forth, traffic police permission to have the last word when editing local roads, which take care of the village.

Newly the village could sell the vehicle towing, for which the period of six months after the announcement of the flue owners opt-in.
Municipalities will be able to exclude freight transit through its territory by road second and third classes under the threat of fines for freight forwarders.
The amendment also eliminates the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of the current paper, which will be used after 1 January next year.
The government says it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
Usti exprimátor goes to trial.
Overpriced newborns, he faces 10 years.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project, welcoming citizen.
Police wanted to prosecute this case and MEP Zuzana Kailová (CSSD) deputies her but not issued.
According to the legal qualification of the case threatens two to ten years in prison.
The trial is currently scheduled for two days in October.
According to the prosecutor Mandík MACÍK caused damage to at least one million crowns clear from the indictment.
The applicant relies on expert opinion.
Former members of the city government by the plaintiff in its function improperly gain the economic benefit of the company that organized the welcoming citizen.
Mandík accused of then-Chief Magistrates department of municipal services, education and culture imposed to address a tender five related companies.
When in the competition another company that offered the lowest price, canceled the competition hall.
The offer, then the city had entrusted administrator and entered the competition only company Darothore, which then contract the City Council allocated.
City worth at least a million more.
Both accusations led to ensure the company Darothore award of the contract to host the event in newborns, Usti nad Labem in the long term and coordinated least acted contrary to the requirement to process with due diligence, says the prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him were aware that the company Darothore subsequent to obtaining the contract accounted Usti nad Labem for the implementation of the action newborns, the price to be compared to the fair value of the services actually disproportionately overcharge.
In three years the company according to the documents for the project has collected more than five million.
The city eventually paid off just one part, roughly 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid by the expert opinion of at least one million crowns overpriced.
Mandík had previously refused any violation of law.
Any crime I did not commit, I am innocent.
I do not understand this fabricated case, said earlier the former mayor of that city under his leadership just picked up on a similar project in previous years.
From 2008 to 2010, the event provided the agency Roxy II.
"It was the same terms for the same money," he added Mandík.

Hungarian police reportedly embarked on a fugitive dog.
Then persuade journalists to delete the record.
Hungarian police said on the border with Serbia briefly detained the cameraman AP and forced him to delete the recording, in which a police dog allegedly knocked a refugee.
The Hungarian government but denies this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when an AP cameraman filmed Luca Muzi migrants across a cornfield near the Hungarian town Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
Police intervened against refugees and one of them had on certain Syrian attack dog with a basket on the nose.
Dog man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a refugee," knocking, hard men.
That all Men films, he noticed one of the cops and let him go.
The journalist then he could not even call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Policemen Muziho done in a dark place at the registration center for refugees and asked him to show them what is recorded.
Then he was ordered to delete the entire line.
The men thus lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says that he felt in danger because dogs were nearby.
AP sent a protest letter to the Speaker of the Hungarian Minister Zoltán Kovács.
Police conduct therein described as unacceptable and said that journalists should be allowed to cover the event without risking physical violence and not have to worry that the government destroys legally obtained material.
Kovács, citing a police report Muziho description of events questioned.
He said that the police only wanted to give them the journalist showed that on some shots, to which apparently they are entitled.
When they found out that there is not anything he did not force delete.
"Dogs can bark - are trained to deter a little downright scary, but certainly not attacked," says Kovacs.
Unpredictable Champions League.
City to win us a kick, believes Juventus
"It's disappointing, I do not think we deserved to lose," shaking his head Manuel Pellegrini, coach home City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team did not create many opportunities, but the ball is maintained for longer, we had ours.
"The cause of defeat was not a tactic, just Juventus scored two beautiful goals," commented the match Pellegrini, whose team conceded a competitive match after 636 minutes long.
That finalist last season Juventus on it was before mutual encounter exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league's defending champions as the only point and the score of 2: 4 is up to 16th in the table.
I therefore turn to the Etihad Stadium big surprise.
"This win will help us psychologically, kick us," coach Massimiliano Allegri believes that before the new year's had to deal with the loss of three pillars - Pirlo, Vidal and Tevez.
In Manchester, they were represented by Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"It's true, this victory is very important, perhaps because it zooms to winning," hopes Morata.
Because when we are at it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially on offense.
This result can my players deserve.
"Prior to our equalizing goal While we might collect on the contrary, 0: 2, but Gianluigi held us," said coach Allegri goalkeeper Buffon.
"We burned a few good chances," sorry Yayu Touré, City midfielder.
We have to get out of Champions League experience and next time try for a better result.
Angelo goodbye, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we proceed on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all this media craziness around is managed by professionals.
Depending on the needs of the media and also from above.
And for a moment pause.
Today the newspapers and the media full of babies that bear on the hands of their parents dusty roads exodus.
And it raises in man - that a European man - automatically guilt and compassion.
Well, they do not come here just kids desperate note on shots landing barges to the Greek islands that babies on them so not much to see!
Well, somehow they recently disappeared from the television pictures of ships headed for Lampedusa refugees before the French border near Menton, in whose beautiful promenade sunrays thousands of young men.
A large portion of young blacks.
And also disappeared images from Callais where these swarthy and black men waiting to see whether they can crawl through a tunnel under La Manche.
Perhaps it's nedojímá.
Neither the pictures of primitive Christian church Eritreans somehow did not make the peoples of Europe special impression.
Too much of it sticking out falsehood.
So when it comes to the quotas for refugees, and somehow conceals that it is not only unfortunate kids from Syria, but also vystajlované - for the elderly: the fashionably curried - young men.
Whose musculature look like they just got out of a fitness center.
This is only one personal experience.
This summer at the Turkish - Muslim - Cypriot we lay on the hotel's private beach.
Regardless, it was a private, arrived at the beach at once a large group of cars.
But no ham.
And they got young blacks.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In the hands, of course, smartphones.
But the private beach is not interested, and workers - Turks, Muslims! - There is obviously afraid.
They occupied all the chairs.
Who did not lie to him and he was not at sea, he had bad luck.
They dressed as they were from the US rapperského film.
Caps on their heads with a nail, white and colored Adidas on his feet.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and began to feast.
Occupied tables around, stuffed the next sitting tanned and white bar guests - read Muslims and Europeans, without being asked.
Mothers with children fleeing from the dining terrace somewhere to rest.
Incoming coons drank beer straight from třetinek - as in the series of US ?! - On the beach throwing empty bottles around.
Constantly they yelled loudly at one another.
But it was not English.
Then they began to drink wine, also straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the swimming pool - in designer swimwear, especially the young ladies - in the water screaming and yelling, mothers with children and pensioners fled in terror and in half an hour he was at the beach and pool or one non-black guest.
All disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
Our staff are afraid of them and just talk.
The waiter told me tonight sotto voce: "You saw the gold, what they wore?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, it certainly did not work out," said the waiter.
I remembered: "I know everyone had around their necks massive gold chains.
And one around his neck for about dvaceticentimetrový massive cross of gold.
And women were as a goldsmith.
"These are drug traffickers?" I asked.
"But you saw the booze," said the waiter.
Drugs do not fit or do not use.
They smuggle something else entirely.
So now I knew what was smuggled.
But in June 2105 it still for me it was not so important.
I had no idea what was coming.
But the secret service and top politicians should know first.
They do not know that.
In Europe at that time issued about 1.5 million immigrants.
And go and go and go.
Today it became clear that the main problem of the European Union is that the totalitarian-political-correct politicians, intellectuals and seemed bound to them lobbying and economically important groups in Europe have the greatest power.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly acknowledged a major power in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, also the EU's leaders and television, including ours.
For example, a recent television pictures of the enthusiastic welcome the refugees in Germany are at a Moscow television images of August 1968th
Certainly, the station was a couple sluníčkářů, but most importantly - staroněmečtí - Muslims welcomed their kinsmen.
Babbled long weeks in the news on Czech Television, as apparently, according to some research, the Germans almost everyone for coming emigrants.
But who was only a few days in Germany, he knows that is a lie like a tower.
This is confirmed by other information.
For example, the famous opinion poll organized by ARD - Czech Association of public broadcasting corporations of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD wanted a week before more than 50% of Germans to accept more refugees.
It also meldovaly our television.
However conceal what the next day broke in Germany: that in a poll vote on article revealed that 94.5 percent of Germans want no more immigrants - survey involved 67 000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "Our commitment to multicultural society has failed totally."
Furthermore, he said: "Germany gives up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All the efforts of such coexistence totally failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, according to her did not work strategy, which people from different cultural backgrounds allowed to live side by side without integrating. Today there live with us, and we had some time deluded itself that it will not stay that someday disappear.
But this is not reality.
Multicultural approach, when we say that just live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.
Utterly failed.
But neither Merkel probably not have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MEP for the SPD, the only one in europarliament reportedly does not have a high school diploma - yes, it's one of whom Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could from the minute playing a concentration camp guard - like anymore performed.
It seems particularly under the influence of the recent statements of German politicians that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that except for some, most European politicians supported these statements, statesmen countries that were victims of Nazism, they are horrified.
What is it with Germans happened?
With these rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who for years has tried, at least outwardly, to deal with its terrible past aggressor and murderer of millions?
They are right, those who say that the soul of Germany is the devil sow aggression, violence and superiority?
He was right chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when all its power Velkoněmců halted attempts to dominate the entire Central Europe?
When told that Greater German idea destroys Germany?
Probably he should have.
When he was weaned, she began preparing for the first World War.
Great German idea, which led Europe into German and two wars that cost millions of lives are likely to be returned in a different form.
After attempting Marxists dominate the state, such as the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany, for example, based on ecology, which was incidentally one of the main ideological doctrines of Nazism, he began to develop new German ideology.
We would say Sluníčková.
German elites have long prevented the establishment of German nationalism, and so presage the room all the fighters against the atom enthusiasts seeking paradise for everyone, quietly support the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest to live.
To satisfy the restless young people everywhere want to do something differently and better, fully sided with the fighters against warming of the planet, stop nuclear power plants, etc.
A forgotten that in this current there is also strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and antislovanský current classing Slavs difficult for vermin - since the days of Karl Marx, who, after parents Jew, was mainly German nationalist.
And, as shown by recent statements Schulze and German ministers of overtly threatening recalcitrant eastern states, idea, leader of Germany.
Which must obey without protest.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when you do that, we mix that immigrants are very impressionable group of voters that we have what we have.
And behind it, as always, the capital, particularly German, which meets and which tyje from the fact that Germany actually through banks and EU dominates most European countries.
Pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduced into the German ecologism swamps and multiklturalismu today and brought them home and maybe even bring millions of Muslims.
Who, seduced by the siren voices, soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel wants to see and begin to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors by force, again, a portion of its population - but it seems increasingly smaller part - ideological infatuation, but eventually it catches up with reality, as always.
Germany will again burn?
Muslim hostels are already burning.
What does the German government, to public protests erupt against the Germans incoming Islamists?
Who come to help the Muslims have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated so to take local customs and laws?
What does the German government until he begins to himself naturalized Muslims, Islamists and incoming Germans, watching with fear the Islamization of his country?
What it will do with the Germans, and even Germany, to rise, people who are loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-Muslim superman?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which provoked in Europe by supporting sluníčkářské ideology, that ideology elitist and essentially totalitarian, and their rapacious banks grows.
And because of a blunt disobedient behavior towards democratic Germans and all menial and disobedient eastern neighbors can not turn out well.
Completion of tomorrow.
The best way to get rid vlezlých Dealers: scare them to death.

Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet while breastfeeding
Brazilian Pediatric Society SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to convey knowledge to women about the importance of a good diet during breastfeeding using images of children suckling from the breast vymalovaného showing unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Thanks excess energy is required for pregnant women and new mothers advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that increased caloric intake is not the only dietary measures, which would be mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic formation of their children and protect them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately also confirmed that unhealthy diets adversely affecting a child's immune system.

But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let sit Hayne for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which performed an Australian convert rugbiové league during the first excavation of bowl out during Tuesday's victory 20: 3 to Minnesota.
But Tomsula show that he has confidence in the players and gave him another chance to come back and cast him into the game after being injured Reggie Bush.

US stood up for immigrants who demanded compensation for the property.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and the property has a new owner.
After 1989, it was impossible to return the property, so the pair approached the state with a request for compensation under the law on extrajudicial rehabilitations.
The court has awarded them the first of the required amount, ie over 2.8 million crowns, but the appeals court changed their claim so that they admitted only less than 90,000 crowns, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined by the price regulations in 1991.
Emigrants defended the Supreme Court and the groups awarded them originally claimed amount.
The Ministry of Finance, which had the money to pay, but a complaint to the Constitutional Court.
In the meantime, there has been a change in the social and economic conditions that compensation awarded under the legislation then in force - even then accounted for adequate compensation in respect of property taken away - today is only a fractional amount of the property value.
"This can not be borne by the interveners in restitution as authorized persons of their rights to demand at least since 1995 and had the opportunity to receive a grant of a refund sooner," said Judge-Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk why the Constitutional Court sided with the emigrants.
"US has repeatedly advocated that the ordinary courts proceeded in restitution matters so that any inconsistencies were interpreted to the detriment of the beneficiaries and to always achieve the purpose of restitution legislation, thus atonement property injustices caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state," said the judge.

4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four year old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of demonstrators against the proposal for a new state constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, says that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal says that police used tear gas, then fired into the air before they resorted to rubber bullets.
Twenty police constables and five civilians were wounded, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill, but is traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused the large number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and eased their political influence.
Another demonstration in western Nepal have also been reported tharus ethnic group, which calls for creation of their own state.
From August 10 it was during the violent engagements killed at least 40 people, including 11 policemen.
the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but very controversial issue in Nepal, which was centrally controlled for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been going on since 2008, but the lawmakers to expedite the process after a devastating earthquake in April which killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers this week voted in Kathmandu on provisions of the draft constitution and officials stated that the new charter should be taken into Sunday.
Certainly we must not panic now.
After losing the championship on ice Litvínova you have not mastered even a home game against Sparta hockey team (3: 5).
Are not you afraid of similarly disastrous entry into the extra league a year ago?
I hope that nothing like this to be repeated.

For mildly obese diabetics could be a useful weight loss surgery
Benefits of weight loss surgery for the moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it's too early to say whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes are living longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
"Mortality data take time to show," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study Surgery JAMA.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery are used to reduce stomach different methods.
Reduce hunger and limitations of the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery proved effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the survey was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI), a value of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the relationship of weight relative to height, it is considered normal in the values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI value of 25 or higher indicates overweight persons and those with values above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study used by researchers from the General Hospital Min-Sheng of Taiwan Using data collected from the study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in medical treatments of diabetes type 3 people were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery, according to a study decreased from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained those who were not given the surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly equal to the value of the 29th
Among patients with diabetes surgery was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
The drug treatment group was compared to diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partly only about 2 percent of patients.
It also was to control blood pressure, trigylceridů and "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored the patient A1c level of hemoglobin in the blood, which reflects the continuous blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below the level of 7 percent, according to the researchers.
After the operation, the average value of the hemoglobin A1c from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
The drug treatment group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - which is reflected in improved levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to principal investigator Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average scores of the two types of operations.
After the fifth year of the bypass group lost more weight compared with gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg) achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery, after five years, there is evidence from studies of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone at the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study were obese people who underwent bariatric surgery, about 29 percent more likely to survive the next 15 years, compared to the group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone's comforting outcome for people with a BMI under 35, who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where the work is critical, because it states that the surgery safer in a group with lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also further claims that people and their doctors should begin to take seriously the weight after a drop of the patient's BMI between 27 and 30 thereof.

The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He argued that in the current circumstances would be interested mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, whether it was in any way remarkable, on the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible that all came to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in a crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solution to bring true peace and real development, particularly through the education of the Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their country.
We need to limit the use of force.
Use of force will never solve these problems, "he added.
When dealing with issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on actions to George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claims that "violent US reaction triggered uncontrollable chain of events.
After 9/11, I expressed condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not violent way.
I know that his motives were good, but he used force and created unintended consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
The fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested sanitizer for the last four years
Poison control centers around the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitizer, according to poison control centers in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of poison control centers in Georgia, the number of ingestion sanitizing agents in children under 12 years of which have been reported to poison control centers has risen from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids these products receive more, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be transported to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some kids are drinking sanitizing agent intentionally, while some want to impress your friends, or as a challenge to social media.
Videos on YouTube show teens how to drink sanitizing agent due to the cheap fuss.
Teenagers allegedly mixed the sanitizing agent with a mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the scent of an attractive resource.
"Kids do not think about the fact that they would not be hurt," said Lopez.
Lots of attractive (sanitizing agents) are those that are perfumed.
Dipozici are sanitizing agents with aromas of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
Sanitizing composition comprises between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children can mean a few sips of alcohol poisoning.
"It is a highly concentrated alcohol," he said on Fox 4 in Kansas City Medical Director of Audit poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
Glass of whiskey would also have left just lying around but these people sanitation means let out and when they get children, it's a quick way to alcohol consumption.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year old girl who recently ate at school to four sips of the sanitizer with aromas of strawberries and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered drunkenness among adults, according to Dr Chris Ritcheyho, emergency doctor who took care of her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah pronounced slurred speech and was unable to walk after he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors had monitored overnight in a separate children's hospital due to any signs of brain trauma, because a girl because of alcohol fell and hit his head, Ritchey says.
"It was very scary," she told CNN Ortoria Scott, mother Nhaijah.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange to have sanitation equipment out of the reach of children.
Outside alcohol poisoning were some sanitizing agents associated with death.
In 2013, two women died from Ontario after swallowing sanitizing agent, which contained toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Medics believed that the product comprises methanol, lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was presented as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth year students in northern New York, planned to poison their "bad" teacher placement of antibacterial products around the room, "according to police reports.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary means and forbade their presence in the room.
Police thwarted a plan assessed as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,

Why I witnessed executions in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the lateness of legal intervention, I'll watch the killing of men.
If this happens, and I hope that does not happen, I'll sit in the viewing gallery in the death chamber Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see Richard Glossipa, which will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me was one of four officials who will witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January over his best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day was coming, I'm getting out of this have to worry.
Why do they do that?
I accepted this invitation because it is in my opinion a good way I will be able to terminate the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch the executions in America, and it is often more applications than available places, performs a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will monitor the execution of the whole impartially.
I can not do it.
I'll sit alongside Richard Glossipa closest friends and I created a special bond with him through months of phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
The boy I like.
We laugh often, when we speak.
Prison authorities say they can not be both a witness and a journalist, so I would not have allowed a notepad and I can record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, compromising his impartiality.
This is the lesson.
Tell the story of an inmate as he'll like it, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that "it could formulate better," but he thinks what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He does not tell me what to write, and even if it did, I would not listen to him.
I told him that I may at any time remove from the list of witnesses.
But he wants an international journalist who will be on site ready to tell a story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help practices against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist for the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to the podcast series that I created.
I am not going to repeat all the details.
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in the offense.
But I believe that there is a high probability that the murder of the innocent.
I firmly believe that it has not provided sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, bad execution.
And it is from this perspective that I would follow his death.
I can not say that I truly objective.
For this purpose, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is to experience what it is to see a person whom I love, die unnecessary deaths.

Peeter Moody accused organizers Racing Victoria that he had last year in the stable try to get a spy and threatened to immediately cease racing.
He focused on the organizers and the Department of Racing Victoria and integrity based on the conviction against him have his campaign with a late scratching Lady Tatai maintenance on race day, which for him Wednesday was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what's best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation regarding Lidarin positive swab to cobalt, which can not explain.
He bit his tongue about the allegations of espionage for 18 months and did not want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I did not say anything about it, that I sat on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that you come out all at once," said Moody.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Today I'll go home and have a good sleep.
I want to walk with your head up and to the owners thought that doing my best for them.
When you start to think the opposite, then there would not be a coach.
I would then consider what I'll do my license.
Previously, Moody launched in an interview for racing.com bomb that he tried to spy on the integrity of the department.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I shall appoint over the issue - and offered him a job in my stables behind that finds information about things that are in my stables perform" Moody said on Racing.com.
Of course I thought I was an impostor.
If so, should all show their information, because in an effort to catch me utterly failed.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundra, the current CEO of RVL, have it at the time were aware of and are aware of today.
I should think that it becomes a personal matter?
RVL lets you grow a pair of balls and arrange to people outside the coaching position took responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
I am for the industry wrong?
I am really so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe I need to take my license and push me away and I have no doubt that what they now say they will provide material for thought.
But I got to a point when it does not matter to me, and I'm sad.
It makes me really sad.
I'm going to push them and transfer the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of your family and I can walk away.
Levels of frustration trainer to increase with prolonged investigation because of cobalt including LIDAR and recent scratches made him feel that "could clock his license on the table."
Mood, best known for the preparation of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on the day of the race "ridiculous" after he was riding on the legs applied clay or mud poultice, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
Do I have to take full responsibility, "he said.
Someone on my team accidentally smeared mud on his leg.
Could it be last night.
It could have happened yesterday, too, and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of tiles on the day of the race, which organizers have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules, knows nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strike back rivals because of allegations wrestling
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, criticized the intervention of his players as "agenda setting" were two minions NRL premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referee allowed the Storm players' wrestlovat "of his players during the team's controversial victory in the final qualification Storm in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a thinly veiled comment on STORA after his team won the final qualification of the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game a "show" rugby league and according to him, two from Queensland were "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy defended the intervention of his players and said that while they concentrated on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation had increased the confidence because his team is criticized by two leading coaches, which may mean that they are afraid of defeat since the team Storm.
"It still comes - I do not remember that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when he beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we are in the last year have not changed anything in our defensive system and techniques, in recent weeks we have only emphasized the contact during surgery, and for us that meant a turnaround.
Trent's been here three years and apparently coached by a great team, so it probably is not used to losing, which for him could be a bit of a shock.
It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy Bennet devalued the idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentors, that Bennetovův team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiership playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about the exciting football.
He was right in that it was his Saturday game much more exciting than ours. It was also just as exciting, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George were criticized because they were boring team and Wayne had said that he could not care less.
But now a team that can play the style of game that he seems annulling, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
Such'd like to play football, if you were available for this type of players.
This opinion said in 2010, and now wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so you can not play such a style.
It makes me more confidence because they say such things because they are afraid of the match against us.
Six weeks ago of us probably did not even think about that when they got to the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that the match Storm and Roosters fell more than wickets in a match Broncos and Cowboys.
Team Broncos game was probably good I did not look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18 in our game were two other attempts, but it's an exciting football?
Or are breaks and neskórování attempts this interesting?
For me, this agenda.
As we mentioned, it means that at a particular phase meet again.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must get for the injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilshere, it is still only September, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason to not play again for Christmas.
The best scenario already indicates that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games and English, from the perspective of history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship, is clearly uncertain.
A great pity this nnejnovějšího problem is that Wilshere finished strong last season after an ankle injury and then got back into form during former-season.
"This type of injury does not endanger the career," said Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It did not affect his ankles or injuries suffered before.
This could be from a purely medical point of view true because Wenger admitted that there was relative risk of further injury, whenever any player returns during the season.
Also, there arises an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. Records 23 different injuries Wilshere since six years ago he had his debut game.
Over the past five years, he played only 65 league games Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in six of eight seasons from 2007-08, was one of two Premier League clubs who lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in recorded injuries during last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you return after an injury, you are vulnerable period of time when you need to strengthen your body and get the competition," says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope that his body stabilizes, I'm sure you do, and will have the career you deserve.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and probably Arteta board.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep a balance and let the players, who need it to breathe," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are the clear favorites to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo also been defeated in a total of 41 matches after last season to keep the campaign "invincible".
Stadium on Wednesday night was rocked by an earthquake 3.2 Richter degrees.
It was this year for the tenth time in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League capitulated against Monaco and he remains the remote possibility that it will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is enormous," said Wenger.
Arsenal that never happened.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I must be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
No similar view in variety shows is glaring, especially since, as men's need to open up to more desperate than ever, as týče suicides among young men under 15 years old.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to solve this problem, identified the Campaign Against Living Miserable (CALM) 2015 as the Year of Man, which aims to challenge the culture that prevents men to seek help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression found that, in the event that the victim had a high enough percentage of Friends "healthy mood," their chances of recovery are doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a ring of friends sane half the chance of occurrence of mental problems.
But friendship to work, must of course be possible to achieve.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the communication, the immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives doubled our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and successful, even though we are in reality rather isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our desire for personal growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And how long ago explained, a billionaire and game creator, money really can not buy more happiness.
Beauty series Friends was for him a source of ideas.
None of the characters not defined by their work, but their personalities that shone through friendly interaction.
Joey and Chandler's humor often victims, while watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stems from the realization that yes, men, they may also relate to, even though he usually let his feelings to himself.
Samaritan to me one worker explained: .... "my role listener people who feel depressed or have suicidal me really confirmed that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak opening to discuss the issues.

Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidim and Edinson Cavanim after scoring a goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored his debut in the Champions League and helped PSG on Tuesday beat the Swedish team Malmo.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began his journey in the Champions League final a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and the PSG player sent the French champions to victory, but then threw away several chances to finally increased their lead when Cavani scored with his head after 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the team Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions, because they focus only on qualification to the knockout rounds, but to improve their road to the quarterfinals, which recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even if you get three points, it was not a classic performance team Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were wasteful in front of goal and was later replaced against his home team and the club where he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"The Champions League is not easy to win out or at home, so a 2-0 win makes our adversaries problems and look comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things that we need to improve the procedure of the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we nevstřelili one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three changes to PSG, who had taken home this weekend 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in the League 1, but was eclipsed in the fourth minute Di Maria.
Argentine wing has been identified as the man who moves PSG in Europe to a new level after transferring from Manchester United, which took place last month and showed why when he ran onto a pass Marca Verrattiho the defense Malma and a beautiful finish sent the ball behind his back Johan Wilanda to remote corner of the net.
However, if someone expected that starts magnificent victory PSG had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the playoffs and get to this stage, with the enrollment of nine internationals in the line-up and five defenders and two midfielders were retracted serious contender.
But apart from Nikola ĐURĐICA missiles that narrowly missed the far corner of the net, Kevin Trapp 34 minutes, the attack did not offer much.
Instead, they PSG themselves pecking on behalf of the attack, poor passing and a miserable finish that was not good either from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot or five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his team arrived at the network shortly after the start of the second half Cavani.
However, it proved much more convenient when it came to preparing the chances for his teammates and it was just his pass, when Di Maria sent a rotating shot that ended in Wilandově goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks Cavanimu, the Uruguayan sent a header over the line for the sixth goal of the season after he Ibrahimovic pass after pass from the left wing Maxwell.
That ended any thoughts Malma about the possibility that they could extract something from the match, and only a brilliant intervention from Wilanda great proximity dashed hopes David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even while he was relieving Ezequiel Lavezziho goal at the end of the match unappreciated.
The coach Age Hareide Malmo one later acknowledged that PSG were a grade above his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League was held in December last year."
Since then we have played only Swedish league that is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches is not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
For them it was a spectacular match.

As the refugee crisis blew Schengen area.
Emergency flares fired by Germany far nestmelila European crew, but forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal first with the issue of refugees: it will be more systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers, once set foot on the old continent - particularly in Greece, rather than fought over the future division of refugees according to quotas based on the amount that while increasingly receding reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, changed the Interior Ministers of the Member States a priority.
Before we worry about the final destination of migrants, it is first necessary to filter out those who come today to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for the management of migration," says the text considered by ministers in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis, the common currency of the EU finds that it is in danger in his next big integration project.
Germany might be surprised, but does not lose its resolve and pressure increases.
Restores border checks, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those who seek asylum in this country.
Central power that makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe possible.
As evidence already served, that Austria and Slovakia on Monday to join this action.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are thinking about it too, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary to move forward long ago.
This exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the rules of the Schengen area.
It is a domino effect, but sees a blind man.
A key question for Berlin and Paris is now effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy and Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière on how intensively discussed during a private conversation with his three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but realizes the tough.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics already recorded and identified with taking fingerprints two-thirds of newly arrived refugees.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory, because they are more afraid than others to put on their shoulders are left camps where the refugees massed on its behalf.
Real black hole remains in Greece.
On the islands near the Turkish coast landed this year, more than 200,000 people, which is more than twice recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who arrived straight from Syria after having gone through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which are still in a financial breakdown and waiting for the new government, folded her hands in her lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and source of worry now common for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Juncker Commission promises to introduce checkpoints occur as soon as possible, but gave no number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece are applicable to the whole of Europe," they agreed on Monday the EU interior ministers to mobilize on this front.
Thus we deploy in this country the teams of European Border Control Agency Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to expand its capacity to receive refugees and to strengthen supervision over the islands.
"What will be needed adequate financial resources," warns text submitted to Ministers for approval.
In terms of law will continue to have the last word Athens.
Question emergence of real European border guards have not been officially raised, but Europe has come close.
New emergency osmadvacítky anyway pushed to one side the question of mandatory quotas and 160,000 refugees who have already raised early Juncker Commission and the European Parliament strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland still they do not want even to hear.
They regard it as an attack on its sovereignty.
Number, but not the obligation, on Monday was maintained in the text approved by a majority osmadvacítky.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise involves the reallocation of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, as has already reached an agreement in June during a hectic EU summit, says Le Figaro.

One of the ways the kind of situation can cope travel agencies be brought to the state for reimbursement.
Another option is to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and in our market, then we will only act as an agency, said Deputy Chairman of the Association Pope John.
The draft amendment to say, according to him, contains also the institution of a bank guarantee, but so thoughtless that it is impossible to implement in practice ever since the bank guarantee can not be expressed in unbounded amount.
The association is also changing existing practice de facto useless.
