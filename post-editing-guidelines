You will be shown:

  - a "reference" segment of text;
  - a corresponding "hypothesis" segment of text.

There are three parts to each annotation:

(1) Read the reference segment;

(2) Read the hypothesis segment and compare its meaning to the meaning
of the reference sentence;

(3) **Making as few changes as possible**, correct the hypothesis
segment to make it
  (a) have the same meaning as the reference segment;
  (b) grammatically correct.

You will need to use your own judgment on occasion to determine whether
or not a change to the hypothesis is really needed. What I would like you
to do is to ask yourself the following question:

  "Is the change I am thinking of making going to make any *practical*
  difference to the meaning of the hypothesis?"

If the answer is "no" or "probably not", then do not make the change.

With respect to grammaticallity, the annotation requires you to
wear your layperson hat as opposed to your linguist hat.

Please try to avoid spending a lot of time on any one sentence -- intuitive,
sensible judgments are preferred to nit-picking or getting bogged down.
