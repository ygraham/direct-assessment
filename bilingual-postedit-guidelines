You will be shown:

  - a Russian segment of text;
  - a corresponding translation into English.

There are three parts to each annotation:

(1) Read the Russian segment;

(2) Read the translation and compare its meaning to the meaning
of the Russian segment;

(3) **Making as few changes as possible**, correct the English
translation to make it
  (a) have the same meaning as the Russian segment;
  (b) grammatically correct.

You will need to use your own judgment on occasion to determine whether
or not a change to the translation is really needed. What I would like you
to do is to ask yourself the following question:

  "Is the change I am thinking of making going to make any *practical*
  difference to the meaning of the translation?"

If the answer is "no" or "probably not", then do not make the change.

You have been chosen to complete this annotation based on your native speaker
knowledge of Russian and excellent knowledge of English. However, since you are
not a native English speaker, when you have completed your post-edits they
will be checked for English fluency according to the opinion of a native
English speaker. Therefore, if your lack of native English causes you to be
unsure of the fluency of a translation or your own post-edit of a translation,
please be comforted in the fact that the annotation only requires your best
judgment, as although English fluency is required for this task, native English
fluency is not.

Please try to avoid spending a lot of time on any one sentence -- intuitive,
sensible judgments are preferred to nit-picking or getting bogged down.
